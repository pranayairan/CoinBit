Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Diamond”.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Diamond coin could win over a lot of Bitcoin users with its faster transaction times, lower fees and easier access to new users. Bitcoin is a hugely popular coin but it can be quite difficult to use! Many critics of Bitcoin argue that the coin won’t be a valid replacement for normal money until users can make small purchases; quickly and easily. A network offering these features will also appeal to small businesses dealing in low priced, high-volume goods like coffee or fast food. However, in my opinion the price of Bitcoin Diamond will have to be more stable before it attracts any big-brand clients like Starbucks or McDonalds.\r\n\r\nOne of the main safety features of blockchain technology is encryption. Private personal information is hidden using computer code. Some critics of Bitcoin think that not enough user information is encrypted. For example, all transactions and their amounts can be seen by anyone using the Bitcoin network. This can make tracing the real identities of users fairly easy for governments and other organizations. The team behind Bitcoin Diamond wanted to encrypt more user information. However, they have recently decided not to add more privacy features to BCD. They feel that governments will soon start passing laws that stop cryptocurrencies from hiding user data. In a statement published on Medium, the team noted Japan and Russia as examples of this trend.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Diamond is processing much larger blocks than Bitcoin in the same amount of time. Larger blocks mean more transactions and a quicker average transaction time. Bitcoin Diamond makes it easy to mine BCD with less powerful computers. GPU mining allows more users to get involved in supporting the network and this can only be a good thing. Bitcoin is the world’s top cryptocurrency but it’s still quite difficult to use.

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\"\u003eBitcoin Core software\u003c/a\u003e. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\"\u003eBitcoin SV\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\"\u003eBitcoin ABC\u003c/a\u003e","web":"https://www.bitcoincash.org/","twt":"bitcoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc","forum":"https://bitco.in/forum/forums/bitcoin-abc.25/","github":"https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc"}},{"currencyName":"BCI","info":{"desc":"Bitcoin Interest (\"BCI\") is a competitive staking cryptocurrency focusing on three key areas Technology, Community, and Savings.

Bytecoin allows users to make absolutely anonymous money transfers through the CryptoNote algorithm. CryptoNote uses CryptoNote ring signatures to provide anonymous transactions and allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group. The signature only proves the message was created by someone from the group, but all the possible signers are indistinguishable from each other.\r\n\r\nEven if outgoing transactions are untraceable, everyone may still be able to see the payments received and thus determine one\u0027s income. By using a variation of the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, a receiver has multiple unique one-time addresses derived from his single public key. After funds are sent to these addresses they can only be redeemed by the receiver; and it would be impossible to cross-link these payments.\r\n\r\nAs a primarily peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system, Bytecoin has many of the same use-cases as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e. Created in 2012, Bytecoin is one of the earliest developed cryptocurrencies. Until recently, the team behind the coin has kept themselves anonymous. Now, though, they’ve opened up multiple communication channels, removed some layers of anonymity, and even built several local communities.\r\n\r\nBitcoin’s PoW consensus algorithm heavily favors miners that use powerful GPU and ASIC machines over those trying to mine with CPUs. This causes the network to centralize around the more powerful miners. Bytecoin attempts to close the gap between these two classes of miners with a new algorithm, Egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW). Egalitarian PoW uses a version of skrypt, a proof of work function similar to the hashcash function used by Bitcoin. The difference between the two is that scrypt isn’t memory bound. Because of this, you can produce highly efficient CPU mining rigs. GPUs will always be about 10 times more effective, though.\r\n\r\nThe Bytecoin project has been fairly fractured since its inception in July 2012. Previously, several isolated teams worked on the project without seemingly communicating with each other. This led to numerous forks and versions of the coin. In July 2017, the team decided to change their image and provide more transparency to the community. The team still remains pseudo-anonymous by only providing names and headshots on their webpage – no bios or social media links. But, it’s tough to expect more from a project that’s focused on privacy. The team has been busy at work refactoring their code and are planning to release a new public API on February 6, 2018. They’ll also be entering the Asian, Middle East, and African markets throughout 2018.","web":"https://bytecoin.org","twt":"Bytecoin_BCN","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/","forum":"https://bytecointalk.org","github":"https://github.com/bcndev/bytecoin"}},{"currencyName":"BCR","info":{"desc":"Bitcredit is the first full attempt at crypto currency based financial services.

Developed by early contributors to both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Skycoin’s platform is completely secure, infinitely scalable, and ISP independent. It uses its own specific distributed consensus algorithm, called Obelisk, instead of other commonly used algorithms like proof of work (POW) and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dProof+of+Stake\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eproof of stake (POS)\u003c/a\u003e. Obelisk uses the concept of ‘web of trust dynamics’ which distributes influence over the network and makes consensus decisions depending upon the influence score of each node. Each node subscribes to a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node’s network of subscribers determines its influence on the network.\r\n\r\nSkycoin is very fast. With transaction speeds close to 2 seconds and no transaction fees it can rival any other cryptocurrency on the market as a payment method. The transaction costs of Skycoin are covered by Coin Hours. This is value paid to Skycoin holders for each hour they hold a Skycoin. Skycoin is against charging transaction costs and mining incentives as it only drives up the costs of the network. The biggest benefit of Skycoin is that it is energy efficient due to the Web-of-Trust social proof. It can even run on a 30-watt cell phone processor making it great for mobile payments. Centralization becomes less of an issue when anyone can participate in the blockchain. Sia stores tiny pieces of your files on dozens of nodes across the globe. This eliminates any single point of failure and ensures highest possible uptime, on par with other cloud storage providers.\r\n\r\nA major goal of Skycoin is to promote actual usage of cryptocurrency rather than speculation. Skywire, the flagship application of Skycoin, has the ambitious goal of decentralizing the internet at the hardware level and is about to begin the testnet in April. However, this is just one of the many facets of the Skycoin ecosystem. Skywire will not only provide decentralized bandwidth but also storage and computation, completing the holy trinity of commodities essential for the new internet.\r\n\r\nSkycoin also has its own ICO platform called Fiber, their own deterministic programming language, CX, derived from Golang, a private decentralized messenger system called Sky-Messenger, and a decentralized social media platform, BBS.\r\n\r\nHere is another way to think of Skycoin: An open-source, community-owned, hardware-based peer to peer internet designed from first principles and leveraging the incentive system of the blockchain.","web":"http://skycoin.net/","twt":"Skycoinproject","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/skycoin/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin"}},{"currencyName":"JANE","info":{"desc":"Live JaneCoin prices from all markets and JANE coin market Capitalization.

The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.

The project offers a network, which we’ll discuss soon, that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges. That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.\r\n\r\nBancor’s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn’t call for an exchange of tokens with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain’s protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert back and forth between those reserves as users request it.\r\n\r\nThe Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation that’s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos\"\u003eTezos (XTZ)\u003c/a\u003e. \r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens’ built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens’ smart contracts always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible for balancing a Smart Token’s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token’s total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios, known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps.\"","web":"https://www.bancor.network/","twt":"BancorNetwork","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor","forum":"https://blog.bancor.network/","github":"https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts_eos"}},{"currencyName":"TOPC","info":{"desc":"Topchain is the world’s leading brand in the gaming blockchain, reshaping the game industry structure with decentralized concept to create a global de-centralized gaming ecosystem.

As avid supporters of cryptocurrencies, we realize that cryptocurrency adoption for the purchase of goods and services online has been slow. While there are many merchants that are beginning to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, consumers are reluctant to spend their cryptocurrency. The primary reason for this is the lack of trust. Once a cryptocurrency transaction has been made and payment is sent from the buyer to the seller, there is very little protection or recourse for the buyer in the event of a fraudulent transaction, which creates reluctance. Unlike using credit cards, which provide full buyer protection as banks can reverse a fraudulent transaction, there is no such intermediary for cryptocurrencies. In another example, Paypal has been able to succeed at a large scale due to its popular buyer protection service. Buyers on eBay can shop worry-free, knowing that they can file a claim with Paypal, who serves as the mediator in the case of a dispute.\r\n\r\nSparks is aiming to be the leading cryptocurrency platform in eCommerce. Sparks will be the first cryptocurrency platform that incorporates a buyer protection service. This process will largely be automated and fully utilize features already available within the Sparks core code. Not only will holders of Sparks be protected when spending their SPK, the Sparks platform will be made available to retailers all over the world as a service. Using the service will require subscription payments to be made in the form of SPK, creating utility and demand for the coin.

Solarin was their first project, which gained popularity as the most secure phone in the world. Though it was a success and was endorsed by famous celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, the company declared a layoff of about one-third of the staff by 2015. The reason they announced was developments in other fields. In late 2017, Sirin Labs announced the ICO (Initial Public Offering) of Sirin Lab Token (SRN) in order to give their operations a new direction. Now, they focus on bringing new technology for mass adoption.\r\n\r\nSIRIN Labs has a vision of creating open source and secure devices for mass adoption. The biggest problem SRN tokens face is convincing average users of smartphone that a high security phone is worth investing in! If SRN tokens follow the recent trends and other products by SIRIN Labs become a success, then that day is not away when SRN token will be one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.

There’s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\"\u003e(Siacoin)\u003c/a\u003e to identity verification \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\"\u003e(Civic)\u003c/a\u003e. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin’s\u003c/a\u003e original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we’ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.","web":"https://token.breadapp.com/en/","twt":"breadapp","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/breadwallet","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-core"}},{"currencyName":"SSV","info":{"desc":"SSV is an X13 pure proof of work alternative crypto currency with a reducing block reward until a height of 500,000 where the reward becomes flat at 13 coins."}},{"currencyName":"BRK","info":{"desc":"","web":"http://breakoutenterprise.com/","twt":"BreakoutGaming","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/BreakoutCoin/Breakout-Chain-Client"}},{"currencyName":"KCS","info":{"desc":"KuCoin is an international cryptocurrency exchange based out of Hong Kong that currently supports the trading of 210 digital assets. What’s unique about KuCoin is that they share 50% of their overall trading fee revenue with users holding their exchange-based token. In a similar fashion to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\"\u003eBinance\u003c/a\u003e, KuCoin offers relatively low tradings fees and incentives for holding (or trading) its native cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, the founders started researching blockchain tech and went further to build the technical architecture for KuCoin in 2013. 4 years later, the exchange launched with the ultimate goal of “becoming one of the top 10 worldwide hottest exchange platform[s]” by 2019.\r\n\r\nAs stated on their official website which lists 12 core members, “Kucoin aims at providing users digital asset transaction and exchange services which are even more safe and convenient, integrating premium assets worldwide, and constructing state of the art transaction platform”. CEO and founder, Michael Gam, is a former technical expert at Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group. He was also a senior partner at Internet giants like MikeCRM and KF5.COM. OO, Eric Don, is referred to as a “senior Internet researcher, systems architect, and Internet industry star”. He is also stated to be the CTO and senior partner of IT companies including YOULIN.COM, KITEME, and REINOT. However, it’s unclear if these websites actually exist as they did not show in a Google search or when entering the website domains.  According to his LinkedIn, he is currently CTO at Youlin Network Technologies, yet there is no mention of KITEME or REINOT.\r\n\r\nWith its growing user base and increasing number of cryptocurrencies being offered, KuCoin may be set up for a strong run in the markets. KuCoin Shares volume is expected to grow as the daily trading volume on KuCoin, hence, trading fees collection grows \u0026 thus, the size of dividend payout grows. This can lure investors to hold KCS token which may even increase its value.

The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority or banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is design to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.

According to the founders, the Bitcoin blockchain has become too centralized. Large companies with huge banks of mining computers now mine the vast majority of Bitcoin. For the founders of Bitcoin Gold, having large companies control the Bitcoin network defeats the purpose of a decentralized ledger and peer-to-peer currencies. In response, they’ve initialized the Bitcoin Gold project. It’s an alternate fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that implements changes that make mining more equitable.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Bitcoin Gold is to create a network where anyone can become a miner with only basic hardware. As a result, Bitcoin Gold mining would be spread among many miners, instead of a few large companies.There have several features such as decentralization. Bitcoin Gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash-BTG, which cannot be run on the specialty equipment used for Bitcoin mining (ASIC miners.) This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with common GPUs. Besides, there have fair distribution. Hard forking Bitcoin’s blockchain fairly and efficiently distributes 16.5 million BTG immediately to people all over the world who have interest in cryptos. \r\n\r\nOther methods, such as creating coins with a new genesis block, concentrate ownership within a small group. There also have a replay protection. To ensure the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Gold has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses, essential features that protect users and their coins from several kinds of accidents and malicious threats. Most new mineable cryptocurrencies involve ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms, and it’s becoming something of an industry standard to promote decentralization. In that respect, Bitcoin Gold holds a lot to be excited about. At its core, it’s about transitioning the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e network to more decentralized mining.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we saw above, there’s not much evidence that the current Bitcoin mining system is broken. There have been some small complaints, and it’s not ideal that the network is so centralized. Nevertheless, miners on Bitcoin have a lot to lose if they wield their power too aggressively. There are also new entrants to the Bitcoin mining community that are decentralizing control from a few key ASIC farms. The general consensus from Bitcoin experts is there’s not enough new in Bitcoin Gold to warrant an independent investment. While it certainly doesn’t hurt to hold onto your free BTG that you receive as a result of the fork (if you owned Bitcoin before Oct 24), wait until the dust settles before deciding whether to buy more.\"","web":"https://bitcoingold.org/","twt":"bitcoingold","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU"}},{"currencyName":"KEN","info":{"desc":"Kencoin is an industry-specific cryptocurrency, targeting the adult entertainment sector.

The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications. \r\n\r\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The “AppCoin” ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\r\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\r\n\r\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\r\n\r\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins’ solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them. However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.","web":"https://appcoins.io/","twt":"AppCoinsProject","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppcoinsProtocol","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Aptoide/AppCoins"}},{"currencyName":"SXC","info":{"desc":"Sexcoin is the payment transaction system of the future for the adult industry via Android and PC wallets.

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM’s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes’ clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this ‘Dynamic Proof of Location’ is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace’s control.","web":"https://www.foam.space/","twt":"foamspace","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/foamprotocol/","forum":"http://discourse.foam.space","github":"https://github.com/f-o-a-m/foam.css"}},{"currencyName":"BSTK","info":{"desc":"Source BlockChain is a leading economic collaboration platform based on information traceability, with features such as openness and ease of development.

Merge mining is simply the ability for miners to simultaneously mine two different cryptocurrencies based on the same algorithm. The project attempts to remove the middleman and put money directly back into merchants/consumers hands, eliminating hefty fees currently charged by big corporations like Amazon and eBay. To facilitate near-zero fee transactions, you can use its native cryptocurrency, Syscoin (SYS), to pay for goods on the marketplace. However, you can also pay using alternate cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\"\u003eZcash\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\nSyscoin is led by a team of developers and was created by its current core developer, Sebastian Schepis. According to Proof of Developer, a website that verifies, evaluates, and ranks developer teams, Syscoin received 5 stars in 2014. Blockchain Foundry maintains Syscoin as its flagship product, with a mission to “disrupt markets by leveraging the potential of blockchain technology”. In March of 2017, Blockchain Foundry partnered with the Microsoft Azure ecosystem and is one of the founding members of the Digital Identity Foundation (DIF). Other founding members of the DIF include the likes of corporate giants such as Microsoft, Accenture, ConsenSys, and more.\r\n\r\nSyscoin’s blockchain delivers faster speeds along with lower transaction fees than its predecessor, Bitcoin.

It was created by Kik Interactive in September 2017 in a token distribution event, raising over $98 million from 10,000 participants. The purpose of the token is to facilitate value transfers in digital services such as gaming applications and social media, and will initially be launched on the Kik messenger to leverage the application\u0027s 15 million monthly active users. Use of Kin over other tokens is incentivised by providing a daily reward to developers of these digital services based on their usage.\r\n\r\nKik’s latest effort has been allowing users to reward creators directly. Today’s digital content and social media companies monetize their websites using advertising. This model requires that these companies go after economies of scale, adding new users quickly. They also want new users to spend as much time as possible on their platform so they can maximize ad views and therefore revenue. The leadership at Kik believes this trend toward the attention economy is a mistake. Their philosophical argument for creating a cryptocurrency is that advertising and attention seeking is cheapening the content ecosystem and our relationships. Using Kin Coin, they hope to enable consumers to pay creators and developers directly. This crowdsourced patronage is an important trend in social media. We’re seeing similar projects that have gained traction with the likes of Kickstarter or Patreon. These services allow people to pay creators directly, without the need for advertisers. \r\n\r\nKik needed further funding in 2017. Instead of raising money from venture capitalists, they decided to launch an ICO to create the token behind their new rewards points system. The token sale for Kin Coin was a success, raising $98 million in September 2017. The sale included over 10,000 people from 117 countries. Unfortunately, Canadian citizens were not allowed to participate, and Kik is a Canadian company. Some argue this dampened demand and contributed to the ICO not reaching its hard cap of $110 million. A total of 10 trillion KIN will exist, of which 750 billion are currently in circulation. The token launched on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\nKin Coin will launch on Kik later this year. The idea is for monetization to integrate seamlessly into the app. Users should be able to reward creators simply from their wallets with a few taps. Kin Coin is designed to be mobile-first, and a wallet app will arrive in the coming months as well. A few test users can use Kin Coin right now on Kik. The only thing you can do so far is buy some custom digital stickers for use in chats. Expect more features upon launch later this year. Over time, the idea is to allow other digital services and media applications to also integrate KIN. It won’t be exclusive to Kik. However, Kik will be the first company to launch Kin Coin integration.\r\n\r\nKIN’s value decreased following the ICO as hype died down. In January, KIN rode the wave along with much of the cryptocurrency market to an all-time high. Since January, the price has fallen, but never to pre-January levels. KIN is an ERC-20 token, so you can store it anywhere that accepts Ethereum. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect?locale\u003den\"\u003eMyEtherWallet\u003c/a\u003e is a good option for paper storage. Of course, a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet is the gold standard for security. Kin has the backing of a major startup with a large active user base. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well crypto integrates with an existing community, especially a younger community who might not care about crypto. They just want things to work well. Solving the problem of giving crypto a great user experience is an important step to making crypto useful. If Kik can figure that out with the Kin Coin then this will be an interesting project to follow.","web":"http://kinecosystem.org/","twt":"kin_foundation","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/kikinteractive/kin-token"}},{"currencyName":"MBRS","info":{"desc":"The Embermine Project is an effort to provide Users a versatile operating system for their endeavors.

This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth. \r\n\r\nWhereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo’s federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain. \r\n\r\nThis multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo’s infinitely scalable infrastructure. \r\n\r\nKomodo’s tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with Komodo’s architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. If one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency. \r\n\r\nThe Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it’s also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished with a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes, providing protection from 51% attacks. \r\n\r\nJoin Komodo as we continue to accelerate the global adoption of blockchain technology.

SingularDTV is a blockchain entertainment studio laying the foundation for a decentralized entertainment industry. Building the future of rights management, project funding, and peer-to-peer distribution, SingularDTV’s platform empowers artists and creators with powerful tools to manage projects from development to distribution.\r\n\r\nThe entire concept behind SingularDTV is a kind of “entertainment studio”, which offers artists and creators of media content a large platform with many programs and tools that can develop and market their products there. The company’s concept is based on 11 modules, some of which are already available as features on the platform, but some of which will not be released until 2018 or 2019. The modules are: Tokit, Decentralized Exchange, Codex, Launch Pad, Legal Repository, Production Service/Crew, Equipment Rental, Talent Management, Marketing, Union Interface and EtherVision.\r\n\r\nThe company was founded by Arie Levy-Cohen, Kim Jackson, Zach Lebeau and Joseph Lubin.The founders have the vision to create an entertainment platform that offers artists and producers a good marketing time on a decentralized basis.They are competing with streaming services such as Netflix or Youtube. The company will even publish the first specially produced television series on the platform in the autumn of 2017. This project is led by Kim Jackson, who is also a producer and president of “Evotion Media”.\r\n\r\nSingular-DTV wants to gather a total of $7.5 million. In order to do so, a crowdsale which will last for a month will be held. During this time 500 million SNGLS tokens will be up for sale at a fixed rate of 0.00125 ETH per SNGL during the first 10 days, and will drop by 12.5% every 4 days until it reaches 50% (in 12 days). These funds will be used to complete the \"Singular\" tv show, launch the S-DTV Documentary Division, buy a stake in the Ujo rights management platform and to develop the TVOD distribution portal. A minimum of 34m SNGLS must be sold, otherwise, the project will be canceled and all the investments will be returned.  Since the issuance of tokens takes place on the Ethereum network, you\u0027ll only be able to invest in the crowd sale using Ether. This is done by sending ETH to a special smart contract wallet address, that in turn issues and sends you the newly created SNGLS tokens. This can be done using any wallet, but in order to be able to see and transfer your tokens, you\u0027ll need to use the Mist Browser or the S-DTV Light Wallet.

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\"\u003eBitfinex\u003c/a\u003e).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\"\u003ePoloniex\u003c/a\u003e or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.","web":"https://tether.to/","twt":"Tether_to","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"CANDY","info":{"desc":"UnicornGo is a blockchain based online game in which users are be able to buy, sell, exchange, upgrade, breed and even clone mythical unicorns.

Capital Coin aims to change this by bringing awareness to the masses on the benefits of public distributed ledger systems over traditional banking.\r\n\r\nCapital uses a pure POS consensus, thus mining is not possible. The main reason for avoiding the inclusion of miners is because of how inefficient the Proof Of Work consensus is. The only way for the chain to function under POW is by miners solving increasingly complex, cryptographic hashes. There is a strong correlation between network adoption and hash rate, making it very difficult to ever scale Bitcoin sustainably to a point where it would become the main global means of exchange. Currently, the electricity consumed from mining Bitcoin worldwide is enough to power every single home in Nigeria, a country that houses over 185 million people.

The Storj project is owned and developed by Storj Labs Inc. Storj intends to facilitate a faster, cheaper, and secure file storage solution than traditional cloud storage platforms. To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn. The company is headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. Shawn was previously appointed as CEO, but in March 2018, he stepped down from the post to serve as CSO of the company.\r\n\r\nShawn was replaced by Ben Golub (Ex-CEO of Docker) who currently serves as the Executive Chairman \u0026 Interim CEO. Co-founder John Quinn has been appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer. The company launched its initial coin offering (ICO) of the new tokens on May 19, 2017. At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

Essentially, the only way to do business is in cash. This is a headache for dispensary operators. The Tokes Platform provides a convenient and safe digital solution for both merchants and consumers. In the midst of this cash hurdle, the legal cannabis industry is compliance heavy, requiring cultivators and dispensaries to keep meticulous track of their businesses. Our supply chain solutions provide blockchain based tracking and compliance from cultivation to analysis, to out-the-door packaging.\r\n\r\nWith blockchain technology, we can track and store information about genetic strains, testing data, and harvests.\r\n\r\nWHY TOKES, WHY NOT JUST USE BITCOIN?\r\nTokes is bigger than providing a temporary solution or service. The success of Tokes is merely a stepping stone to our end goal. Education is the most critical aspect of user adoption, and has been largely overlooked by other projects. We are operating in a technologically advanced space, and although we understand the mechanics of cryptocurrency, it’s no secret that 95% of the population does not. We’re undertaking huge efforts to educate and inform partners at the merchant level on how to adopt and implement our technology right into their dispensaries. We’ll further these efforts by similarly teaching the consumers on how to use the technology.\r\n\r\nNot to be overlooked, one of the greatest marketing advantages we have as a business is that we have immediate access to approximately 85% of the local dispensaries in Las Vegas, while our partner TheraCann has offices in the Mid Western U.S., Canada, Germany, Australia, and South America.

Furthermore, the administrators of the HSMs are located in different countries (geo distributed) adding to COBINHOOD’s security system. Furthermore, all crypto asset deposits in COBINHOOD’s online wallet will be backed by insurance.

Bitcoin had consumed that market at that time. That’s why experts didn’t expect it to succeed. The team then realigned their vision and revamped the method of operation to build Crown not only as a leading digital token (known as CRW) but also a self-sustainable blockchain platform for building and running new economy applications. As a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e-based and inspired digital token Crown(CRW) can be used to pay for a wide variety of products and services. It can also be traded against other altcoins through various online exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe Crown network was founded by Filip Major and Jan Brody in mid-2014. The team comprises of Artem Brazhnikov as the lead developer and Chris Kabble as the test manager among several other developers, designers and advisors.

These nodes are used to host user applications, facilitate CRW payments and provide cryptographic proof of data integrity. Nodes are dedicated servers that connect to a blockchain network and help grow by hosting applications, validating cryptocurrency transactions and enabling the blockchain to act as an instant payment service. Due to numerous continuously growing nodes on a platform, it becomes very difficult to manage application platforms like Crown. One of the most vital roles of a node is to provide peerless security. A user can help the community grow by creating and running one of these servers, while consistently earning Crown(CRW) tokens as a reward.\r\n\r\nCrown coins can be bought in exchange of other cryptocoins like Bitcoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e on a wide range of cryptocurrency exchanges like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin\"\u003eKuCoin\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bittrex\"\u003eBittrex\u003c/a\u003e.

Investment researchers and market players like Walletinvestor.com predict steady growth in the value and performance of the Crown token. If a user buys Crown worth 100 US dollars in July 2018 at the price of $0.399, they will be an owner of 250.579 CRW coins.

The advantage of transitioning to Proof-of-Stake is to avoid the centralized mining pools that may eventually threaten Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Most Bitcoin mining has been centralized in China, which is not necessarily a good thing for the currency. Proof-of-Stake is known to discourage centralized mining pools. This makes BlakeStar ideally suited for dedicated staking devices and low-power/low-spec systems.","web":"http://www.blakestar.io/","twt":"blakestarcoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/blakestar","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/cryptofun/blas"}},{"currencyName":"CST","info":{"desc":"In Cryptosolartech, we will obtain our own cryptocurrencies, in a farm where we will install 3.000 equipments to mine cryptocurrencies, in two different variants to optimize profitability, as well as being able to self-supply the farm with our own energy, coming from a solar photovoltaic plant, installed in Spain, this energy can also be distributed as a service for electric companies.\r\n\r\nCryptosolartech is a ERC-20 type token that will work on the Blockchain of Ethereum.

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\r\n\r\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\r\n\r\nThe business logic of CyberVein\r\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\r\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\r\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\r\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\r\n\r\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\r\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\r\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\r\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine. \r\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\r\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\r\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\r\n\r\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\r\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price. \r\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\r\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\r\n\r\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\r\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\r\nThere’s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept. However, the existing DAG in the project before the release unit verification, most are using PoW and CyberVein will use our PoC mechanism is put forward.\r\nCyberVein contribution to prove: a response to block in the chain of the abuse of power or force concentrated and algorithm. PoC is based on the user\u0027s contribution to the network, add the appropriate hash calculation, to determine whether can win in the competition mechanism in the network. In traditional blockchain PoC can be used in the process of mining.\r\nIn each have the same hash miners work force, contribute more to the network resources miners (such as he contributed more hard disk capacity, or bandwidth, or power, etc.) will have smaller hash difficulty, so as to have more chance to beat competitors in the probability, acquired the right to the manufacture of new blocks.\r\nIn the DAG, when a user has more units under the condition of (he contributed more hard disk storage unit in the network), it will be more likely to reference the existing units, and obtain the corresponding fees.\r\nIOTA and Byteball projects in PoW validation of the role is mainly used to prevent the witch attacks and network to some extent abuse problems, and we believe that the use of PoC and other mechanisms, and can be done at the same time, encourage more users to participate in and contribution to the attack of prevention effect.","web":"http://www.cybervein.org/","twt":"cyberveingroup","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"CRC***","info":{"desc":"CRC is the currency that will serve the community and the platform that will be built during the second phase of the coin we\u0027ll become stable enough to allow the merchants to feel safe using it.

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD — every Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal — a token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 — it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into “wrapped ETH” (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This “tokenizes” ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into “pooled ETH” (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a “collateralized debt position” (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin — you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so — margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.","web":"https://makerdao.com/","twt":"MakerDAO","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js"}},{"currencyName":"DAN","info":{"desc":"Being an investor in cryptocurrencies is not easy, it takes a lot of time and causes a lot of stress.

It isn’t a decentralized exchange.  Rather, it facilitates decentralized exchanging through ring-sharing and order matching. Decentralized and centralized exchanges alike will be able to implement Loopring, giving the exchanges access to cross blockchain and cross exchange liquidity and giving investors access to the best prices available on the broader market.  Moreover, Loopring is blockchain agnostic, meaning that any platform that uses smart contracts (e.g., \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\"\u003eNEO\u003c/a\u003e, Ethereum, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\"\u003eQtum\u003c/a\u003e) can integrate with Loopring.\r\n\r\nServing as its head, Loopring founder Daniel Wang used to run a centralized exchange called Coin Port back in 2014.  “At that time,” he told Coin Central in an interview, “[I was] trying to solve the problems of centralized exchanges, and then I realized that it’s not possible.  Those problems are inherent to the centralized exchange model.”  Thus, he began conceptualizing what would become Loopring.  In the past, he’s also held a position as a Google Tech Lead and was a co-founder and VP of Yunrang Technology. Loopring’s CMO, Jay Zhou, was formerly employed by Ernst and Young, helped found SJ Consulting, and used to work in PayPal’s Risk Operations unit. Johnston Chen, the project’s COO, has worked as the chief information officer at 3NOD.\r\n\r\nLoopring is not a DEX, but a modular protocol for building DEXs on multiple blockchains. We disassemble the component parts of a traditional exchange and offer a set of public smart contracts and decentralized actors in its place. The roles in the network include wallets, relays, liquidity-sharing consortium blockchains, order book browsers, Ring-Miners, and asset tokenization services. Before defining each, we should first understand Loopring orders. At its root, the Loopring protocol is a social protocol in the sense that it relies on coordination amongst members to operate effectively towards a goal. This is not dissimilar to cryptoeconomic protocols at large, and indeed, its usefulness is largely protected by the same mechanisms of coordination problems [20], grim trigger equilibrium, and bounded rationality.\r\n\r\nThe Loopring Protocol can facilitate trading between ERC20 tokens. Loopr needs to convert Ether to Ether Token for trading as Ether is not ERC20 compatible, but Ether Token is. Converting between Ether and Ether Token will be done for you automatically when you submit an order, but if you want to trade frequently, we strongly suggest you to convert some Ether to Ether Token beforehand manually; otherwise each order will take one more blockchain transaction just for the ETH-WETH conversion which takes time and gas. Conversions between ETH and WETH are done on-chain through Ethereum transactions. ETH and WETH are always converted 1:1 which is guaranteed by the WETH smart contract. The WETH smart contract also guarantees the total WETH issued is exactly the total ETH deposited. In other words, ETH and WETH is equiviate in value, and WETH is just the ERC20 form of ETH.\r\n\r\nThe Loopring blockchain project had managed to raise almost 15 million US dollars during the period of the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/loopring\"\u003eLoopring ICO\u003c/a\u003e, as all the regulatory experts watched this unprecedented crowdfunding. Daniel Wang, the founder and the main person behind the Loopring ICO, hand made it very transparent that the interface is quite bad but the underlying mechanism and the Order matching facility is very great. Loopring mining can be initiated very easily by using various performance calculating devices such as CPU, GPU, as well as application specific integrated circuits. The Loopring mining process can be initiated through the high-end Linux systems, according to reports. Loopring mining is basically a metaphor which is not similar to the Bitcoin mining but here the users need to match the specific orders from a huge database.  Specifically, Loopring mining requires the usage of the ethereum nodes along with JSON API, IPFS, etc.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/loopring-lrc/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for the full review of Loopring.","web":"https://loopring.org/","twt":"loopringorg","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/loopring","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Loopring/ico"}},{"currencyName":"RBIT","info":{"desc":"Live ReturnBit prices from all markets and RBIT coin market Capitalization.

Through this reward system, the foundation will see a rise in a currency that will be able to reach a broad market, including a vast number of people who have yet to participate in any cryptocurrency economy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Harvard Business Review: “To protect the blockchain vision from political pressure and regulatory interference, blockchain networks rely on a decentralized infrastructure that can\u0027t be controlled by any one person or group.\" The integration of blockchain and dentistry is an extraordinary concept; one that requires the creation of a community in which transparency and shared responsibility can take place.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, Dentacoin expects the platform to drastically improve dental health and hygiene habits, thus improving the quality of life for individuals resulting in improved overall health and increased longevity.","web":"https://www.dentacoin.com/","twt":"dentacoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentacoin","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/dentacoin/aftercare-app-android"}},{"currencyName":"SEND","info":{"desc":"Social Send is a blockchain project advancing cryptocurrency into social networks.

It was created based on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dScrypt\"\u003eScrypt proof of work\u003c/a\u003e mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\"\u003eCoinbase\u003c/a\u003e, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin\u0027s 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin\u0027s network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks\u0027. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin\u0027s 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\"\u003eDogecoin\u003c/a\u003e) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins.

Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of “on-demand” services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides. \r\n\r\nTwo different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power, which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.\r\n\r\n● The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users – where customers create reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit’s incentive model.\r\n\r\n● The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system, Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized. \r\n\r\n● In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user’s viewing space, (ii) the right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information. \r\n\r\nAs such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry’s ecosystem by redistributing ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.","web":"https://cosmochain.io/","twt":"cosmochain","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/cosmochain/CosmoCoin"}},{"currencyName":"LINK","info":{"desc":"ChainLink is a decentralized oracle service, the first of its kind. When \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e went live in 2015, it revolutionized what blockchain could bring to enterprise solution and traditional business. Blockchain was no longer just a medium for new age financial transaction, confined to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin’s\u003c/a\u003e potential to disrupt traditional currency exchange. With Ethereum powered smart contracts, Vitalik Buterin opened up a Pandora’s Box of use cases for blockchain technology. Problem is, per their design, smart contracts can only manage data on the blockchain. Their potential, the ability to provide tamperproof, decentralized applications for uses the world over, is still largely untapped, as many of the smart contract programs built on Ethereum lack a bridge to the real world industries they’re trying to improve.\r\n\r\nChainLink’s first component consists of on-chain contracts deployed on Ethereum’s blockchain.  These oracle contracts process the data requests of users looking to take advantage of the network’s oracle services. If a user or entity wants access to off-chain data, they submit a user contract (or requesting contract) to ChainLink’s network, and the blockchain processes these requests into their own contracts. These contracts are responsible for matching the requesting contract up with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The first of these, the reputation contract, is exactly as it sounds: it checks an oracle provider’s track record to verify its integrity. In turn, the order-matching contract logs the user contract’s service level agreement on the network and collects bids from responsible oracle providers. Finally, the aggregating contract accumulates the collective data of the chosen oracles and balances them to find the most accurate result.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ChainLink team does not offer a roadmap, but a testnet of ChainLink’s services should come sometime within Q1 of 2018. Generally, the project’s general lack of marketing and concrete updates have frustrated community members in the past. Sergey Nazarov, the project’s CEO, is known for a quiet community presence that favors of behind-the-scenes work on ChainLink. The team may not hype their project much, but for what it’s worth, they sacrifice brand marketing in favor of product development–and some community members find this focus to be refreshing. For instance, they’ve established an oracle with Swift Bank, and have a few quiet partnerships with zepplin_os and Request Network.\r\n\r\nChainlink has the potential to connect smart contracts with the outside world. It may allow parties to smart contracts to be able to receive external inputs that prove performance and create payment outputs that end users want to receive, such as bank payments. This has the potential to allow smart contract to mimic the vast majority of financial agreements currently available in the market. With the ChainLink Network, anyone can securely provide smart contracts with access to key external data and any other API capabilities, in exchange for financial reward. Although it remains to be seen how the incentive system will operate, there is potential for rewards similar to those available for crypto miners to be available to Node Operators that provide useful data to the Chainlink network.\"\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/chainlink-link/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for the complete review on Chainlink.","web":"https://chain.link/","twt":"chainlink","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainlink/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink"}},{"currencyName":"LUC","info":{"desc":"Driven by blockchain technology, Play2Live creates an ecosystem for streamers, viewers, tournament organizers, and product/service partners.

This is scientifically verifiable the details of which will be made available in the technical paper.\r\n\r\nLUXCORE blockchain features are available to end users at no extra cost. Anyone who uses the commodity LUXCoin can access the blockchain using LUXCORE wallets or mine to support the network and earn rewards. The security features of the blockchain are also available for everyone. As a hybrid chain that supports both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, the chain is more secure than traditional ones. The seed nodes, full nodes, and wallets that are unlocked for staking, also provide further network stability.\r\n\r\nLUXCoin (LUX) is a coin that is implementing Parallel Masternodes, the PHI1612 hybrid PoW-PoS algorithm, and a “Static” model for staking. The variety of innovative features LUXCoin and Luxcore have to offer have put LUXCoin on the radar for many people in the cryptocurrency world. Recently they have bid goodbye to LuxCore and have deployed Luxcore Mercury v5.0. Luxcore Mercury v5.0 features include Smart Contracts, SegWit, block pruning, Phi2 and most importantly a full-fledged marketing campaign! So far they have been right on target as per their roadmap, but the recent Mercury launch has put them a tad bit behind on their schedule. Plus, their Github shows that they have been working quite decently on updating the whole software which is a good sign for any rising project.\r\n\r\nLux will have dedicated masternodes which are servers that run 24 x 7 and 365 days to provide an extra layer of stability and functionality over LuxCore. LuxCore plans to license this feature for businesses. To run a Lux Masternode, a user is required to have 16,120 LUX in a wallet and as a result, they will earn 40% of PoS block reward. Through the introduction of SegWit, Lux will separate transaction signatures. This is achieved by stripping the signature from within the input and structuring it to the end of a transaction. This ensures higher security as it prevents the receiver from intercepting and modifying the sender’s transaction ID in a bid to get more coins from the sender as the data is “detached” from the transaction.","web":"http://luxcore.io/","twt":"lux_coin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LUXCoin","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/LUX-Core/lux"}},{"currencyName":"UGC","info":{"desc":"As an ecosystem consisting of a series of decentralized applications, the core of ugChain is a decentralized account system (DAS) based on blockchain technology.

It supports custom blockchain architectures, and it provides cross-chain interoperability. The Aion project comes at a very appropriate period, in a time where there’s an ever-growing number of blockchains.Thus, interoperability is more important now that it ever has been. Interoperability will expand the horizons of multiple other blockchain platforms, not to mention those of enterprise-oriented companies.\r\n\r\nThe project is led by Matthew Spoke, the CEO of Nuco and board member on the EEA. Other big names include Jin Tu, Nuco’s CTO, who has more than 15 years of experience in enterprise engineering and more than four years in the blockchain industry, and Peter Vessenes who has co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe token is the blockchain’s power-source. It’s used for securing the network, for creating new blockchains, as well as for monetizing inter-chain bridges. AION token is actually an ERC-20 token. In fact, the token is first offered as an ERC-20 token on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id\u003d279\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eEthereum blockchain\u003c/a\u003e, and only then it can be changed to the official AION network token. When that happens, the token can freely stream between two blockchains. The best thing about this is that investors are not required to change their Aion Ethereum token (ERC-20) for the Aion-1 token, as they will always be interchangeable.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy AION, you will need to first purchase another cryptocurrency, preferably \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e.

The mission of DigiByte is to bring the benefits of blockchain payment technology to merchants, consumers, \u0026 mainstream societies across the globe in the most easy to understand way possible. DigiBytes are digital assets that cannot be destroyed, counterfeited or hacked, making them ideal for protecting objects of value like currency, information, property or important digital data. DigiBytes can be sent over the DigiByte Blockchain and forever recorded on an immutable public ledger that is decentralized on thousands of computers across the planet. DigiByte is a decentralized digital asset and an open source based blockchain platform.\r\n\r\nDigibyte was developed by Jared Tate in 2014 who is also its lead developer. The DigiByte Blockchain is not controlled by any private company. The team regularly upgrades its system to add new features. The Digibyte team is developing a mining algorithm swap to make mining more decentralised. Its most awaited project is the “Core 4.1.3” protocol that will let users create and enter into the smart contracts on its blockchain.\r\n\r\nDigiByte has 5 advanced mining algorithms that help maintain mining decentralisation. These 5 Proof of Work algorithms split the Digibyte mining operations and mining power to facilitate secure transactions. The load on the 5 mining algorithms is rebalanced using MultiShied technology. This adjusts the difficulty of all the nodes to avoid the domination of one algorithm over another and manipulation of smaller blockchains. Segregated Witness technology provides scalability by making the ledger size more compact. It also enables cross-chain transactions and single confirmation transactions.\r\n\r\nDigibyte-based platforms include DigiByteGaming, DigibyteTip, DigiByteMarket, DiguSign, Digi-ID, and DigiHash. The core business of this is DigiByteGaming, which provides coins in connection with various games including wow, roll, kass, minecraft and so on. The coins you earn can be used in other games, or you can cash out and gain real benefits over game money. However, the current Korean Game Industry Act makes it illegal to exchange or arrange the results obtained through games, so the possibility of success of this platform in Korea may be smaller than in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nCoin feature\r\n1. Digibytes wants to reach the final issue in 2035 by reducing block compensation by 1% every month. The inflation rate in 2017 is 12%.\r\n2. Digibytes will increase the volume of transactions that the digibit network can handle by executing special code that doubles the block size every two years until 2035. Currently, 560 transactions can be handled in 1 second by 2017, and over 2,803 transactions can be processed in 1 second by 2035.\r\n3. It has evolved steadily to accommodate new functions through four hard forks and three soft forks. These include DigiShield, MultiAlgo, MultiShield, DigiSpeed, and SegWit.\r\n- Successfully implemented Segwit in April 2017. This can be seen as being ready to develop and run technologies such as lightning networks, cross-crossing transactions, and atomic swap.\r\n- DigiShield is a hard fork that shortens the duration of difficulty adjustments to check multi-pool mining, which is not difficult to mine a lot. This technique was later applied by the Digibot team to DOGGE, START COIN (START), ZAGAC (ZEC) and so on.\r\n\r\nCore Value: multi-algorithm \u0026 multi-security\r\n1. MultiAlgo: DigiByte introduced a system for hard-forking in September 2014, in which five algorithms each mined 20% of the blocks. It has the advantage of better decentralization and the ability to use various mining methods than one algorithm. The 5 algorithms are \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?hashing_algorithm\u003dScrypt\"\u003eScrypt\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?hashing_algorithm\u003dSHA-256\"\u003eSHA-256\u003c/a\u003e, Qubit, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/skeincoin\"\u003eSkein\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/groestlcoin\"\u003eGroestl\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\n2. MultiShield: Multi-security, introduced in December 2014 as a hard fork, is based on multi-algorithms. For PoW attacks to succeed, you have to control one algorithm at 93% and the remaining 4 at least 51%, so you can better defend against these attacks. In fact, because it uses technology such as the Nuclear Security Code, it provides security equivalent to five times that of other coins.","web":"http://www.digibyte.co/","twt":"digibytecoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte","forum":"http://www.digibyteforum.com/","github":"https://github.com/digibyte/digibytewallet-ios"}},{"currencyName":"COV*","info":{"desc":"Live Covesting prices from all markets and COV coin market Capitalization.

Digix has two cryptocurrencies, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digix-gold\"\u003eDigix Gold (DGX)\u003c/a\u003e and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger’s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/digixdao-introduces-gold-tokens-ethereum\"\u003eintroduced a new Proof of Asset protocol\u003c/a\u003e (POA).\r\n\r\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault. \r\n\r\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO.

Benefits of AT\r\n\r\nAT is a blockchain-based token native to ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. Members holding AT will be able to get access to a wide range of benefits including but not limited to—\r\n\r\nUsing AT for various products and services on ABCC. For example, members can purchase other digital assets, pay transaction fees and gain preferential access to premium services with AT. \r\nParticipating in various activities and campaigns on ABCC. ABCC will reward members who meet certain criteria. For example, members holding AT will share in 80% of trading commissions collected by ABCC.\r\nParticipating in various activities such as community building, interaction between members and ABCC, proposing suggestions to ABCC and others. \r\n3. Initial Allocation\r\n\r\nBelow is a breakdown of the initial allocation of AT.\r\n\r\n4. Issuance\r\n\r\nWe will adopt a mechanism called “Trade Contribution + Simultaneous Release” to issue AT.\r\n\r\n4.1 Trade Contribution\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT. \r\n\r\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\r\n\r\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., “release” and “distribution”. \r\n\r\nRelease\r\n\r\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on.

Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. The developers of Ardor are the same company behind the open source \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nxt\u003eNxt project\u003c/a\u003e that also aimed to democratize access to blockchain technology. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.\r\n\r\nNxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren’t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you’ve created a new currency that’s independent of Nxt, you’ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. This is also true for currencies that use \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum’s\u003c/a\u003e ERC20 protocol to build on top of the Ethereum blockchain. They pay fees in Ether.\r\n\r\nTo test Ardor’s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\"\u003eIgnis\u003c/a\u003e ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor’s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.\r\n\r\nArdor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.","web":"https://www.ardorplatform.org/","twt":"ArdorPlatform","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ardor/","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"DIG","info":{"desc":"","web":"https://cryptobontix.com/","twt":"","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"CF","info":{"desc":"Californium is a rare, minable cryptocurrency.","web":"http://www.californium.info/","twt":"californiumcoin","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Californium/Californium"}},{"currencyName":"XDCE","info":{"desc":"XinFin (www.XinFin.org) is a Hybrid Blockchain technology company focused on international trade and finance.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e as the base cryptocoin. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\"\u003eBinance\u003c/a\u003e is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale\u003den\"\u003eTrezor Hardware Wallet\u003c/a\u003e are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders’ rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs.","web":"https://district0x.io/","twt":"district0x","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/district0x","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar"}},{"currencyName":"HT","info":{"desc":"HOTTO is a New Concept of Next-Gen Hotel, Resort, and Vacation Package Blockchain-Based.

The only difference is Sia uses blockchain to facilitate transactions Nodes provide storage to clients using the Sia blockchain as contracts. Before storing the data, the data is encrypted into many pieces and uploaded to different hosts. \r\n\r\nSiacoin is created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc. As the traditional storage platforms are higher in cost, more expensive and data is not well protected.

Moreover, it is completely open source which means many individuals have contributed to Siacoin’s software hence there will be an active community building innovative applications on top if the Sia API. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, Siacoin aims to introduce file sharing and be the go-to cloud storage platform for companies. Their goal is divided into 3 time frames which are short-term, medium-term and long-term development. Short-term development focuses on file sharing between Sia users. This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development’s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework.

Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker’s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward – it’s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It’s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker’s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It’s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don’t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.","web":"https://makerdao.com/","twt":"MakerDAO","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper"}},{"currencyName":"VOOT","info":{"desc":"VootCoin is a hybid proof of work and proof of stake alternative crypto currency with a 10% annualised rate."}},{"currencyName":"ARTE","info":{"desc":"Artemine is intended to be the version 2.0 of Minereum - The First Self Mining Smart Contract.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to continue the evolution of Smart Contract technology with the focus on new blockchain mining approaches, in particular the Smart Contract Self-Mining principle.\r\n\r\nThe Self-Mining principle relies on the basis that the Token will mine the coins itself for a specific amount of time without the direct need of Mining equipment or Miners.

It is a first of its kind system that enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network. Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across multiple \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e networks to provide better efficiency and security for the assets.

Also, the blockchain utilizes a PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm, enabling you to earn interest simply by holding onto your earned XP. The concept of real value rewards merged with the blockchain technology of Bitcoin provides an innovative approach to in-game currencies moving towards a unified platform, similar to the standards applied to mobile phone charges, for example.\r\n\r\nThis approach keeps the digital currency completely independent from any bank, central authority, government or corporation but at the same time allowing them all to collaborate and submit proposals, open source code, documentation and content that benefits other participants and parties in the network.\r\n\r\nWhy XP?\r\nThe issues of reducing total supply, reducing stake rate, and large wallets held by team members can be effectively managed through the introduction of the XP Pentanode System. Rather than relying on simple staking for the security of the network, XP will rely on five different types of specialized nodes to provide network security and the verification of transactions. In addition to receiving various annual returns, the nodes will also send a percentage of their stake rewards back to the XP Foundation to be used to grow the network or to be burnt in a transparent and auditable fashion. \r\n\r\nXP Masternodes (Cost: 50m XP)\r\nThese are standard investment-grade Masternodes, paying out at roughly 50% annually. In order to guarantee uptime, stakes will occur every 60 minutes after the node has been active. Annual earnings assume a 24/7 uptime, with bonuses being distributed to nodes for being up and staking for the longest period of time. For each hour staking, these nodes will receive approximately 2,800 XP. The nodes will be configured so that It doesn’t matter whether the node holds 50m or 500m, the payment will be the same. This incentivizes the creation of new nodes and disincentivizes hoarding.

Using blockchain technology, OriginTrail can append immutable data to products as they take each step along the supply route. Thus, each participant not only verifies that their conditions are being met but that at every previous stage, the right conditions were also met by everyone else. This is achieved by making an application layer that allows data to be collected in the real world, and then stored on the blockchain. OriginTrail started out by testing their tracking with organic beef products in 2014, and they are still mostly involved in the tracking of food products in general. It wasn’t until 2016 that they introduced a blockchain into their system.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, they raised US$22.5 million in their ICO. Since their ICO they’ve successfully launched their testnet, implemented privacy features, and achieved compliance with the GS1 standards that are integral to their business model. Their roadmap is robust and full of details, citing certifications with international bodies, alliances with companies, and entering new markets. Their mainnet is scheduled for launch in Q3 2018, and thereafter they appear to be on track to having all their services fully operational by 2020.\r\n\r\nOriginTrail is not the first or only company to recognize that supply chains could benefit a great deal from blockchain technology. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ambrosus\"\u003eAmbrosus\u003c/a\u003e is also going for the same market, though they seem to be focused on food and pharmaceuticals specifically. It should be noted that most supply chains have their own specific quirks, and so specialization might be be a good option. Another potential competitor of OriginTrail is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waltonchain\"\u003eWaltonchain\u003c/a\u003e, a company based in China that puts heavy emphasis on RFID chip scanning as part of their business model. In other words, where OriginTrail wants to leverage existing systems for their infrastructure, Waltonchain wants to try and establish new standards and methods. OriginTrail’s token is called TRAC, and it’s an ERC-20 token, making it storable on any ERC-20 compatible wallet. The total supply is capped at 500 million tokens. The value in TRACE tokens comes from their utility on the OriginTrail network. Tokens are spent to store, retrieve, and send data about supply chains. Since TRACE can be bought and sold in a speculative market, that creates the potential for the price to go up, which would be counter to the needs of people on the network looking for stable prices for setting and getting data. However, prices for data saving and retrieval will be determined by auction, which should counter increasing token value for those using OriginTrail as a service.\r\n\r\nThe Internet of Things is a topic that gets a lot of press, and the general consensus is that it will be standard practice in the future for almost everything in the world to be tracked and traced for a wide variety of purposes. OriginTrail is one company that is demonstrating a concrete plan for exactly how that will be manifest. There really isn’t much to criticize in terms of the overall intention of the project. OriginTrail has identified a weak point in the very important world of supply chain management, that of reliable transfer of information all the way up and down the chain, and aims to provide a workable and clearly understood solution.","web":"https://origintrail.io/","twt":"origin_trail","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/origintrail","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node"}},{"currencyName":"ECASH","info":{"desc":"A more viable currency for Ethereum","web":"https://www.ethereumcash.technology/","twt":"EthereumCash_","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumCash","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/ethereumcashdev/ethereumcash"}},{"currencyName":"NYAN","info":{"desc":"Nyancoin is the official cryptocurrency of Nyancat.

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network’s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it’s a grand-slam idea.\r\n\r\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\r\n\r\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\r\n\r\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they’re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\"","web":"https://pundix.com","twt":"PundiXLabs","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PundiX/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/pundix/ico"}},{"currencyName":"TRIA","info":{"desc":"The CombiCoin is what the name implies a combination of cryptocoins, very similar to an equity fund in stock market.

Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of privacy that’s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn’t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they’ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma’s success. Guy Zyskind, Enigma’s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT. He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT. Sandy Pentland, a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions, is Zyskind and Nathan’s adviser on Enigma.

Enjin is the “largest gaming community platform online” with over 250,000 gaming communities and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that’s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.\r\n\r\nEnjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It’s also one of the first projects testing the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\"\u003eRaiden Network\u003c/a\u003e, Ethereum’s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we’ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that’s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc…) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform – over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it’s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They’ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\r\n\r\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual gaming with decentralized technologies. Enjin Coin project promises a lot, and it is only with the passage of time that we will able to see if it can deliver on those promises.","web":"https://www.enjin.com/","twt":"enjin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnjinCoin","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/enjin/contracts"}},{"currencyName":"MONEY","info":{"desc":"MoneyCoin (Symbol: MONEY) is a latest distributed payment system which is the independent of any one government or bank in the world.

They plan to create their own blockchain with a long list of impressive features. Some are even calling EOS the “Ethereum killer.” But along with all the hype and excitement about EOS, there’s also a large amount of skepticism coming from the crypto community.\r\n\r\nThe EOS Vision\r\nEOS has big plans. It will be a software that will act as a decentralized operating system. Developers can then build applications on the EOS software. It will be highly scalable, flexible, and usable. The most notable feature that everyone is getting excited about is horizontal scalability — what this means is the EOS blockchain will be able to allow parallel execution of smart contracts and simultaneous processing of transactions. This could be a real game changer.\r\n\r\nEOS will incorporate the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dDelegated+Proof-of-Stake\"\u003edelegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus protocol, created by founder Dan Larimer himself. This system is less centralized, uses far less energy, and is incredibly fast — as in, up to millions-of-transactions-per-second fast. Furthermore, there will be no user fees on the EOS blockchain. This would also set them apart from the competition and could help them gain more widespread adoption of their platform.\r\n\r\nEOS also wants to put a blockchain constitution in place to secure user rights and enable dispute resolution. As explained in their technical whitepaper: \"The EOS.IO software is designed from experience with proven concepts and best practices, and represents fundamental advancements in blockchain technology.

The issuance of NavCoin is carried out collectively by the network of miners and joint development by the NavCoin commmunity. The project is open-source and decentralized. Nobody owns or have complete controls over the cryptocurrency. The NavCoin project is open source and available for everyone to take part. NavCoin was known as Navajo Coin, which was rebranding from SummerCoinv2.\r\n\r\nNavCoin is cryptocurrency designed to be anonymous and simple to use. Established in 2014, it belongs to an older class of cryptocurrencies that came before the current wave of ICOs. NavCoin has stood the test of time well. Over the past four years it has implemented various upgrades, features, and improvements. The team is dedicated and knowledgeable, and as a result the platform has seen consistent growth. However, NavCoin has not seen the kind of growth that the other competitors in the race to be the top privacy coin have seen. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dash\"\u003eDash\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\"\u003eZcash\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\"\u003eMonero\u003c/a\u003e have all outstripped NavCoin in terms of adoption and funding. Recently, the project has seen a comeback, as they’ve begun to emphasize design, usability, and experience. NavCoin wants to make it simple and fast to use private transactions.\r\n\r\nSince the early days, one of NavCoin’s strong suits has been its fast transaction times. NavCoin sees block confirmations every thirty seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s ten minutes. This is faster than Monero (2 minutes) and Zcash (2.5 minutes). Dash also averages about 2.5 minute block times, but its masternodes make it possible to send instant transactions. That said, NavCoin has the fastest standard block time of any privacy coin. These fast transactions aren’t expensive either. Where currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are having trouble with high miner fees, NavCoin keeps its transaction costs low. The average fee is only 0.0001 NAV to send a standard transaction. Private, encrypted transactions can be more expensive.\r\n\r\nWhile most other cryptocurrencies implement some form of proof of work mining, NavCoin was among the first to implement proof of stake. Proof of stake relies on users putting up a portion of their NAV holdings in order to gain an opportunity to create a new block. If the network ratifies the new block you created, you’ll receive an award. If your block is bad or contains fraudulent transactions, the proof of work algorithm takes away all the coins you staked. This incentivizes honest block creation. With NavCoin, it’s possible to earn a 5% interest from staking your NAV. In order to do so, however, you’ll need to operate a staking node on the network. You can do this on your computer by downloading the NavCoin Core client and setting the amount of NAV you want to stake.\r\n\r\nThe team behind NavCoin and Valence is Encrypt S Ltd. However, it’s an open source project. As such, they’ve built up a big community following, and anyone can contribute. NavCoin features a very active development team. New updates come out regularly, usually every week. The Lead Engineer is Crag MacGregor. He is also CEO of Encrypt S Ltd. They’re the blockchain development company behind the NavCoin project. He’s from New Zealand. Nav is also one of the most beautiful, easily understood coins out there. This is in large part thanks to their marketing and creative team. NavCoin’s focus on style, branding, and communication sets them apart in blockchain space.

Like its two predecessors, Vertcoin exists solely as a currency, and it uses proof of work to reach distributed consensus. Unlike its two predecessors, however, Vertcoin is dedicated to keeping its mining functions decentralized, so contrary to most PoW coins, it’s ASIC resistant. Branding their project as “The people’s coin,” Vertcoin’s team believes that ASIC resistance invites a fairer, more democratized currency for both users and miners.  Along these lines, Vertcoin sports its very own 1-click miner, a program meant to make mining more accessible to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of Vertcoin was the fact that Scrypt-based ASIC mining chip that is used to mine Scrypt derivative coins such as Litecoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\"\u003eDogecoin\u003c/a\u003e is entering the mass market. That coupled with strong mining pool causes the strength of a cryptocoin to drop as it becomes easier for a specific party to pull a 51% attack and even monopolize the network. Scrypt-Adaptive-Nfactor was created to address that issue.\r\n\r\nVertcoin is zero premined and as of the current design, only 84 million coins would ever be created. Vertcoin is said to be the next generation of coins due to its unique hashing algorithm. There may be more altcoins created based on this hashing algorithm in order to defend their network against ASIC miners.\r\n\r\nLike most all pre-2015 coins, Vertcoin took a deathblow after Mt. Gox was hacked, throwing the entire market into a crypto winter. As such, it was relatively inactive until the revival last spring/summer.  Since then, it has had steady climb up the market cap ladder.\r\n\r\nA 2014 International Business Times article mentions Vertcoin as a potential Bitcoin successor. The article notes that it \"\"hopes to offer an alternative. By taking the foundations of Bitcoin and making some adjustments, Vertcoin punishes miners who use powerful machines and work together in \u0027pools\u0027 to monopolise the mining market.\"\" On July 1, 2014, Vertcoin released a wallet supporting Stealth Address transactions. On December 13, 2014 (block 208301), Vertcoin forked from Scrypt-Adaptive-N proof-of-work function to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dLyra2RE\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eLyra2RE\u003c/a\u003e as a proactive defense against emerging Scrypt-Adaptive-N capable ASICs. On August 10, 2015 (block 347000), Vertcoin forked from Lyra2RE to Lyra2REv2 because a botnet was controlling more than 50% of the hashing power of Vertcoin network. On May 7, 2017, Segregated Witness (SegWit) feature was activated in the main network.

There is more potential for return on investment with a microcap coin than there are with established altcoins. Moreover, you do not have to hand over tokens in an overhyped crowd sale to be a part of this. All you really need to do is download the mining software and get hashing. The coin is one of the easiest to mine as was the developer’s intention. Moreover, given the exciting roadmap that the team has ahead for the project, the future prospects also look quite promising.

Instead, the Nectar token will act as a loyalty token. The NEC is designed to maintain liquidity and market efficiency through the incentivisation of platform loyalty. Users who choose to register for the scheme and take on the role of market maker on the Ethfinex platform, or using integrated decentralised exchange protocols, will automatically generate NEC’s, as a loyalty reward, and subsequently earn a stake in the future development, governance and success of the platform. NEC will adhere to the ERC20 Token Standard to ensure cross-compatibility with alternate exchange protocols interfacing with Ethfinex. This allows other protocols and exchanges to reward users for the liquidity they contribute.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental purpose of the Nectar token is to reward market makers for the value they create, in turn encouraging them to maintain market thickness and minimised spreads on the platform trading pairs. Loyalty points entitle holders to loyalty rewards held in the Liquidity Token Smart Contract, which can be redeemed (in part or in whole) through the Redeem Mechanism upon request. Loyalty points can be traded on a secondary market amongst white listed Ethfinex users. If no tokens are redeemed at the end of a 28 day cycle, the total supply of NEC will grow. Ethfinex will hold an initial supply of NEC which will not grow over time — as a result, the percentage ownership will gradually decrease as new tokens are issued and redeemed.\r\n\r\nThe exact governance mechanism will be particularly important in ensuring the details and implementation of the token can be refined in time for the Ethfinex launch. Defining the perfect liquidity incentive mechanism will be impossible without continuous testing and feedback in real markets, and the governance will complete the loop in allowing improvements to take place.

ETZ eliminates the gas fee system from Ethereum network core and adds a Transaction Restriction Policy Protocol layer that associates the threshold, frequency, depth, etc. of initiating transactions with the account balance to combat DDOS like attacks.\r\n\r\nIn particular, ETZ also draws on DASH\u0027s two-tier network architecture built with Masternodes transaction verification network and blockchain ledger layer, and its built-in community autonomous system to provide users with real-time operation feedback and high transaction concurrency, no longer need to wait for a long transaction confirmation time. \r\n\r\nETZ picks the proven experience of Ethereum on smart contracts, removes its less scalability gas-based fee system and designs a fully accountable trading limit and security strategy against DDOS Class attacks. The final two-tier network composed of the main node and pow consensus layer laid the foundation to achieve free of charge, high concurrency, real-time transactions, independent evolution and several other features.\r\n\r\nWhat does no-fee mean to DApp Dev?\r\nTaking a simple Todolist DApp as an example, its decentralized implementation can be applied to the team task decomposition process, which requires all participants in the project to know the tasks of other members.

According to Ethereum development requirements, all of these operations require gas consumption, which is clearly unreasonable for the users of the application. While in EtherZero, the transaction initiation frequency and the execution depth of smart contracts will be positively related to the balance possessed by the account.

It was written in Javascript ES6 and because of this, the complete blockchain runs in the browser. The main goal of Nimiq is to solve the payment solution, and to provide a browser based payment solution of sending money. They also have nearly instant transactions as well. Nimiq is a CPU only mineable coin, since it uses the Aragon2D algorithm.\r\n\r\nNimiq intends to lower barriers of entry for blockchain technology, and make it accessible for mainstream use. With an operational betanet already live, users can experience how simple it is to mine inside a browser - installation free. Nimiq is making blockchain technology as accessible as the internet, with a vision to truly decentralize the web. Current available cryptocurrencies are complicated and counterintuitive for the average person to use. True internet decentralization is impossible if access to blockchain technology is limited to only the technically oriented people. Until blockchain can be picked up with general recognition and general usage, its true power remains unrealized.\r\n\r\nNimiq originally began as an ERC20 \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003e(Ethereum)\u003c/a\u003e token, known as NET or Nimiq Exchange Token. Nimiq held its ICO throughout June and July of 2017, and raised over 10 million USD. NET trading was enabled shortly after the ICO, and development began on the project’s Github. NET was converted to NIM, the currency that is based on the Nimiq blockchain and network, on March 31st of 2018. Nimiq’s wallet (Nimiq Safe) is built right into the Nimiq website, which means there is no need to download or sync a wallet application. The wallet will lead you through a setup guide, which will help backup and secure your wallet in the case of data loss.

Similar to registering a .com or .io domain name, you register a .bit domain on the network. This domain is censorship-resistant and impervious to activity tracking. Governments and large corporations control traditional domain name services (DNS) servers. This control is how the Chinese government, for instance, can block websites that go against their beliefs. To prevent this level of censorship, Namecoin uses blockchain technology to distribute its DNS amongst the users on the network.\r\n\r\nA pseudo-anonymous founder by the name of “Vince” created Namecoin in 2011. Since then, Vince has disappeared, but a core development team has kept the project alive. The project has several developers listed on the official website and benefits from the contributions of numerous anonymous developers as well. Namecoin has been fully functional for a few years, now, and the development team posts updates several times a month.\r\n\r\nNamecoin was the first cryptocurrency to use Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) for its consensus. By using AuxPow, Namecoin and Bitcoin can be mined simultaneously. In this consensus, the child blockchain depends on the proof-of-work of parent blockchain, which means If a new block is created on Bitcoin blockchain, it will also be added to the Namecoin blockchain. NameID is another technology brought by Namecoin. It serves as an open service for securely registering human-readable names in a decentralized way. NameID is a combination between Namecoin and OpenId, where users can easily convert their Namecoin Identities into OpenIDs. This makes NameID a solution to Zooko\u0027s triangle, which states that there are three desirable properties (Human-meaningful, Decentralized, and Secure) for name participants in a network protocol and any participant can only inherit two properties at a given time.\r\n\r\nNamecoin is among some earliest cryptocurrencies. During its existence in the market, it has seen a high volatility on some occasions, which can be attributed to many reasons. Namecoin has been around in the cryptocurrency market much longer than most cryptocurrencies today; however, despite this, it has not gotten much attention until recently. In 2014, it was among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, which is now changed due to the introduction of hundreds of new cryptocurrencies. Namecoin was abandoned by its creator which can be seen as a red flag by many. The project is currently being developed with the support from its community.

Stratis private chain allows businesses to deploy their own customise blockchain without the costs of running their own blockchain network infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the Stratis platform is to become a one-stop shop for all blockchain things, mostly becoming a blockchain-as-a-service (BAAS) platform. Technology-wise, it is a clone of Bitcoin’s core code, with a few enhanced features and written in C# language instead of C++.\r\n\r\nThe team is based in the United Kingdom but has a decentralized structure with members spreading across the world. Several people on their management team are well-versed in enterprise software development using .NET and C# – a positive sign considering those are the project’s two primary languages. Chris Trew, the founder and CEO, has over 10 years of experience in enterprise IT and was a volunteer developer for the Blitz project.

Wanchain aims to build a distributed “bank”. Just as traditional banks are the infrastructure of the current financial framework, Wanchain seeks to build a new, distributed infrastructure of digital assets to form an improved, modern framework - an ambitious goal indeed.\r\n\r\nWanchain connects and exchanges value between different blockchain ledgers in a distributed manner. It uses the latest cryptographic theories to build a non-proprietary cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger that records both cross-chain and intra-chain transactions. Any blockchain network, whether a public, private or consortium chain, can integrate with Wanchain to establish connections between different ledgers and perform low cost inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wanchain ledger supports not only smart contracts, but also token exchange privacy protection.\r\n\r\nWith Wanchain, any institution or individual can set up their own virtual teller window in the “bank” and provide services such as loan origination, asset exchanges, credit payments and transaction settlements based on digital assets. Under the guarantee of “banks” based on the blockchain infrastructure, more people can participate in financial services based on digital assets. To describe it more accurately, Wanchain is a distributed super-financial market based on blockchain.\r\n\r\nWanchain uses the Locked Account Generation Scheme to secure funds and keys when there are multiple parties involved. Based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme, it effectively breaks up a key into shares and distributes it to all included participants. The Storemen are responsible for maintaining and managing the appropriate key shares of the locked accounts for transactions. This method of key share distribution has a few benefits. Because Wanchain generates locked accounts through multi-party computations, there’s increased decentralization. And there’s more stability because you don’t need every key share to produce a signature for a locked account. If some of the Validators are offline, transactions can still be executed with a minimum number of shares. Finally, any transaction with a locked account is done via the original chain. This means that any chain can easily integrate and interact with Wanchain without the need for new transaction types or validators.\r\n\r\nThe Wanchain Foundation is a non-profit organization primarily operating out of Singapore but also has a significant presence in Austin, TX. Wanchain was founded by Jack Lu, a respected player in the blockchain space. Before his current role, Lu co-founded \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/factom\"\u003eFactom\u003c/a\u003e and started Wanglu Tech, a blockchain application development company. Wanglu Tech has been a primary contributor to the open-source Wanchain project. Dustin Byington serves as the Wanchain President. Byington is a blockchain veteran having founded Bitcoin College in 2014 as well as co-founding Tendermint, a software mechanism to securely and consistently replicate applications across machines. Byington also co-founded Satoshi Talent, a platform to connect blockchain entrepreneurs with developers. WAN tokens were initially distributed as ERC-20 tokens to ICO participants, but it’s now possible to exchange these for tokens on the Wanchain mainnet or buy them directly. It’s a common misconception that WAN is an ERC-20 coin.\r\n\r\nWanchain is a pioneering and potentially disruptive project with its sights set on becoming a super financial market of the world. Although achieving its lofty goal(s) is going to require a lot more work, Wanchain is further along its roadmap than some projects. But there’s still a good bit of “in theory” going on here. As Wanchain is addressing the whole financial market, it has a number of competitors. Most notably \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fusion\"\u003eFusion\u003c/a\u003e, Pantos, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ark\"\u003eArk\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qash\"\u003eQash\u003c/a\u003e; some may even consider big players the likes of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar\"\u003eStellar\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e competitors.

As you probably know, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of blockchains that currently exist, and this number is showing no signs of slowing down its growth anytime soon. Many of these chains, though, are unable to communicate and interact with each other, creating small groups of siloed ecosystems. And, the inability of these groups to work together is holding back the entire blockchain industry. To solve this problem, Blocknet is working to make blockchains interoperable, mobile, and modular. This enables different chains to provide microservices to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion at higher security, faster speeds, and more efficient scalability than today’s current options.\r\n\r\nBlocknet is aiming to be the “Internet of Blockchains” through inter-blockchain connective services. Simply put, Blocknet enables you to develop on one blockchain, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e for example, but access the functionality of other chains, like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\"\u003eNEO\u003c/a\u003e. The team is building the infrastructure using three core components that work together to provide three primary services for these inter-chain decentralized applications (dapps). The XBridge, a blockchain router, is the backbone of the Blocknet platform. It’s the first peer-to-peer protocol to connect nodes on different blockchains, allowing them to communicate with one another. Using the XBridge, you’ll not only be able to perform cross-chain atomic swaps, but you’ll also be able to transfer additional data and execute smart contracts across chains.\r\n\r\nBlocknet uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm with three types of nodes to maintain the network. Service nodes collect and distribute trade fees on the platform as well as prevent spamming and DDoS attacks. To run a service node, you need to hold at least 5,000 BLOCK and keep your node computer running at all times. The Blocknet team recommends that, if you plan to run a service node, you should also run multiple full node wallets of whichever coins you want to support. This maximizes the trading fees you receive. Staking nodes confirm network transactions. When running a staking node, you’ll receive 9-14% annual returns from block rewards as well as a portion of the trading fees. There’s no minimum BLOCK amount you need to keep in your wallet to receive these, but you need to keep the wallet running at all times.\r\n\r\nThere’s limited information available on the Blocknet team. Dan Metcalf and Arlyn Culwick founded Blocknet in 2014 as a fork of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pivx\"\u003ePIVX\u003c/a\u003e. According to his LinkedIn page, Metcalf was a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e developer for 5 years as well as a Senior DevOps Engineer at Philips. Outside of Blocknet, Culwick is also the PR and Media Liaison for XCurrency. Blocknet launched the service nodes on their main net in September 2017, and on March 1st, 2018, the team will release the beta version of the DEX. The project has also partnered with the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/0x\"\u003e0x protocol\u003c/a\u003e to add ERC20 token support on the platform.\r\n\r\nBlocknet is connecting the isolated blockchain systems that currently exist to create one, cohesive ecosystem. Through the platform’s XBridge, the team is building a blockchain Internet in which you can build dapps that utilize features from several different chains. Starting with a DEX, the project has a lot on its roadmap including a service delivery system for blockchains to provide and receive payment for providing functionality to other chains. This is a complex project, but Blocknet already has the partnerships in place (0x, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\"\u003ePoloniex\u003c/a\u003e) to see it through to the end.\r\n\r\nBlocknet consists of the following coins: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xc\"\u003eXCurrency\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stealth\"\u003eStealth\u003c/a\u003e, SonicScrewdriver, Fibre, Librexcoin, APEXcoin, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\"\u003eBitSwift\u003c/a\u003e, XCash, UtilityCoin","web":"https://blocknet.co/","twt":"The_Blocknet","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/theblocknet","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/BlocknetDX/BlockDX"}},{"currencyName":"PITCH","info":{"desc":"Entrepreneurs and Startups can Pitch Investors Live on the Platform","web":"https://tokens.pitch.ventures/","twt":"pitchliveapp","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"RUPX","info":{"desc":"Rupaya is the cryptocurrency and digital payments platform of South Asia.

Signature chains update the private and public keys that secure your address and obscures them after each and every transaction, maintaining the integrity and security of your account even on mobile wallets. Signature chains offer several advantages over equivalent quantum-resistant schemes such as BLISS and Lamport signatures, being extremely compact and lightweight, making it ideal for blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nThe Nexus coin (NXS) is the currency of the network. There’s no cap on the amount of NXS that will be minted. Instead, the coin has a 10-year distribution period in which 78 million NXS will be distributed until September 23rd, 2024. After this time, the supply will inflate each year by a maximum of 3% through the holding channel and 1% through the prime and hashing channels. Nodes create blocks, on average, every 50 seconds, and an NXS transaction requires 6 confirmations. Currently, most transactions cost 0.01 NXS. However, once the 3DC is built and 10-year distribution is complete, transaction fees will disappear. Instead, the system will absorb the fees through inflation. Nexus didn’t hold an ICO. Instead, the project has a Developer Fund that takes a small commission from mining rewards. This commission starts at 1.5% and increases to 2.5% over 10 years. Additionally, 20% of the block rewards are slotted for marketing as well as the production and launch of the Nexus satellite network.\r\n\r\nColin Cantrell, also known as Videlicet, is the founder and lead developer of Nexus. He first named the project Coinshield (CSD) when starting in September 2014. The original code only contained the prime channel; the team added the hash channel in October 2014. In April 2015, the team rebranded to Nexus, and they added Proof-of-Holdings in July 2015. Besides partnering with Vector on the satellite network, Nexus has also joined forces with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/singularitynet\"\u003eSingularityNET\u003c/a\u003e to provide their 3DC architecture to the project’s decentralized AI network. Moving forward, Nexus is releasing major updates following their TAO (Tritium, Amine, Obsidian) roadmap strategy. The releases include the 3DC, mobile wallets, quantum resistance, and the satellite network, among many other things.\r\n\r\nThe creation of new NXS is capped at 3 percent per year and is earned through securing the network by mining or staking. The platform is developed and maintained by the Nexus Embassy who is funded through a 1.5% commission on each block produced and from funds acquired through early mining of NXS. The commission will also gradually increase from 1.5 – 2% over the next 10 years.","web":"http://www.nexusearth.com/","twt":"NxsEarth","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nexusearth/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Nexusoft/Nexus"}},{"currencyName":"WIZ","info":{"desc":"Our aim is to give investors direct access to investment opportunities in the Crypto world and to enable entrepreneurs to raise capital for financing their projects in an efficient, cost effective, and secure way.

Instead of modifying the original \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\"\u003eBitcoin source code\u003c/a\u003e, as many altcoins have done, Nxt developers wrote their own code in Java from scratch. While Nxt is a public blockchain, licenses for private blockchains based on its software are also available for purchase. The developers refer to Nxt as Blockchain 2.0, providing numerous applications beyond simply keeping a public ledger of transactions.\r\n\r\nJelurida BV took over the originally anonymously developed Nxt and now own the IP rights. Kristina Kalcheva, co-founder and legal expert of Jelurida, focuses on how to “explore the different open source licensing models and their enforceability in practice.”  Currently, the main developer is an anonymous Star Trek fan, going by the name Jean-Luc Picard. While there is still the active development of Nxt, the parent company Jelurida is also working on a Nxt 2.0, known as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\"\u003eArdor\u003c/a\u003e, designed specifically to deal with scalability. Ardor will use the same blockchain technology as Nxt, combined with the idea of ‘child chains.’ According to Travin Keith, Nxt foundation Web and Marketing manager, Ardor allows for a “manageable blockchain size, which solves the problem of scalability by separating transactions and data that do not affect security from those that do, and moving all of those that don’t affect security onto child chains.”\r\n\r\nThe core infrastructure of Nxt is complex. This adds risks as compared to the more lean bitcoin, but makes it easier for external services to be built on top of the blockchain. A peer-peer exchange allowing decentralized trading of shares, crypto assets. Since the blockchain is an unalterable public ledger of transactions, the Asset Exchange provides a trading record for items other than Nxt. To do this, Nxt allows the designation or \"\"coloring\"\" of a particular coin, which builds a bridge from the virtual crypto-currency world to the physical world. The \"\"colored coin\"\" can represent property, stocks/bonds, commodities, or even concepts. Arbitrary Messages enable the sending of encrypted or plain text, which can also function to send and store up to 1000 bytes of data permanently, or 42 kilobytes of data for a limited amount of time. As a result, it can be used to build file-sharing services, decentralized applications, and higher-level Nxt services.\r\n\r\nNxt had no mining phase, all initial units were released to 73 people through a one-time fundraiser via bitcoins, after the announcement of the NXT project in the bitcointalk-forums by BCnext. Combine this with a PoS approach, and you have a situation where the big guys run the table. At one point, the Nxt community had a very public spat with Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik. Garzik took issue with the Nxt marketing approach, its anonymous developers, and their responses to constructive criticism. Nxt responded to some of these claims, of course, but it remains one of the more controversial moments in its history.  Another key problem the Nxt network ran into (like so many others) was blockchain bloat. Nodes get weighed down by the onerous task of having to store every transaction on the Nxt blockchain. This was one reason (among others) why Ardor/\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\"\u003eIgnis\u003c/a\u003e came into existence.\"","web":"http://nxt.org/","twt":"NxtCommunity","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NXT/","forum":"https://nxtforum.org/"}},{"currencyName":"ACAT","info":{"desc":"","web":"https://www.alphacat.io/","twt":"ACAT_Official","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"ATCC","info":{"desc":"Live ATC Coin prices from all markets and ATCC coin market Capitalization.

They believe that for someone to be able to understand the technology and use any such platform should have advanced technical skills. \r\n\r\nVOISE addresses these apprehensions by providing an easy to use interface and support for multiple cryptocurrencies as well as fiat to make it as good as any other conventional music streaming service out there in today’s market. The team behind VOISE have conducted extensive research into the industry to identify the problems. They are implementing these learnings to develop a platform that can address most of the issues. The VOISE ecosystem is powered by its own VOISE ERC20 tokens, which acts as\r\nthe primary mode of transaction on the platform. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of VOISE team is to create a platform that can serve the purposes of both the artists and users. The platform built over Ethereum protocol makes use of smart contracts for automation and provides an easy and cost-effective way to sell and stream music.

In order to familiarize people with cryptocurrency usage, they have included support for various payment options alongside the platform’s native VOISE tokens. Even though VOISE tokens remain the primary mode of value exchange on the platform, people can still purchase music using other cryptocurrencies and even fiat. By including fiat payments, VOISE is ensuring that those who are not used to conducting cryptocurrency transactions aren’t left out and at the same time, it also acts as a gateway for them to enter the blockchain and digital currency domain.

Shift Storage Cluster - The default state of the IPFS infrastructure is represented as a globally shared network. This can lead to problems when it comes to verifying data integrity, availability, and custom implementation details such as earning token rewards for running a storage node. For this reason, Shift runs a private swarm. The storage nodes use a custom swarm key to ensure that they can only talk to other nodes using the same key. This also prevents Shift nodes being used to host and deliver content that was added outside of the Shift network which should improve reliability and performance. \r\n\r\nIn order to store data permanently, IPFS implements a concept called pinning. Pinning content means that the content will be available permanently (or until it is unpinned). By default the pinning only applies to a single peer that it is pinned to, but that means if that machine goes offline, the content can be lost. The way around this is by using an IPFS cluster: a subnet (or private net) running the IPFS daemon, containing only Shift peers. The Shift cluster runs as a wrapper around the IPFS daemon. It allows the end user to connect a group of IPFS nodes together so that content can be stored and replicated within the group. The cluster elects a leader to be in charge of keeping track of which content is available in which locations.\r\n\r\nThe Shift cluster provides a modular clustering system for use with IPFS. This clustering system works in conjunction with the IPFS daemon in order to accomplish the following tasks:\r\n\r\n1. Pin, unpin and repin content to peers\r\n2. Provide an HTTP API for communications\r\n3. Assert and follow cluster consensus\r\n4. Replication factor\r\n5. File storage and retrieval\r\n\r\nThese functions come together to provide an extensible decentralized storage system that operates completely independently from the public IPFS network. This is vital to allow users to insert and persist content within the system.","web":"https://www.shiftnrg.org/","twt":"ShiftNrg","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiftProject/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/ShiftNrg/shift-hydra"}},{"currencyName":"611","info":{"desc":"611 (SixEleven) is a crypto currency featuring an included free anonymous domain name system based on reliable Namecoin technology.

It is created by the combination of technologies of RFID and blockchain, which push forwards the integration of block chain and the Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nWaltonchain combines blockchain with IoT (specifically RFID) to create a management system for supply chains. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of RFID technology and a pioneer in the space. Logistics systems are complex and commonly involve several different parties. As these systems grow, it becomes increasingly tough for businesses in the same vertical to coordinate with each other. On top of that, individual entities may have different processes that further hinder the ability to transfer data back and forth. Waltonchain uses RFID identification to track products during each step of production and distribution. \r\n\r\nThe data associated with each item is stored on an immutable blockchain that ensures its accuracy no matter where in the process it is.The Waltonchain team is loaded with supply chain experience. Do Sanghyuk, one of the co-founders, was previously the Director of the Korean Standard Products Association. The other co-founder, Xu Fangcheng was the Supply Chain Management Director of Septwolves Group Ltd. The team is getting support from their Chief Scientist Advisor, Kim Sukku – a former vice president of Samsung. Waltonchain has no shortage of partnerships – several of which are with Chinese provincial governments. The team is working with the Fujian government to create a “smart maritime” blockchain incubator, and with the Jinhu government to build smart air purification and monitoring systems.\r\n\r\nThe Waltonchain architecture makes use of a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake \u0026 Trust (PoST). Waltonchain innovates on the traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) model and integrates a node reputation based system into the consensus mechanism. PoST provides for adjustable difficulty for each node, to ensure that integrity in the ecosystem is rewarded. Waltonchain also gives sub-chain developers the option to choose their own consensus mechanism, for example, sub-chains can strictly just have PoS as a consensus mechanism, and not PoST. Waltonchain, by use of its RFID technology, has introduced a novel way with which blockchain can solve not only the inefficiencies found with supply chain management, but also IoT.

On 16 April 2013 Feathercoin successfully forked from Litecoin by the creation of its genesis block. As a cryptocurrency, creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source cryptographic protocol (the blockchain) and is not managed by any central authority. The hashing algorithm chosen for Feathercoin was the Proof-of-Work NeoScrypt, which had premiered on Phoenixcoin. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dNeoScrypt\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eNeoScrypt\u003c/a\u003e is 25% more memory intense, which makes it less feasible to create ASICs for it. \r\n\r\nThe main programmer is Peter Bushnell, at the time running the information technology for the Brasenose College of Oxford University. He explained his motivation for developing the coin in an interview with Vitalik Buterin. One month after launching Feathercoin, Peter Bushnell left his job as head of IT at the Brasenose College of Oxford University and lived off his Litecoin savings. Feathercoin was launched on 16th April 2013 and as developed by Peter Bushnell.

The Feathercoin network runs on the NeoScrypt hashing algorithm, making it much easier and faster to mine. Feathercoin enjoyed rapid adoption by users soon after its launch, gaining immense popularity, and establishing itself as a worthy contender in a BTC/LTC dominated market.\r\n\r\nFeathercoin can be mined using either processors (CPUs) or graphics cards (GPUs).

The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai’s experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member of Bitfury and Boxer.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger’s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD) in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further. (Australia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world and thus has a large stake in the overall success the company).\r\n\r\nPower Ledger provides a blockchain-based marketplace that can truly change the world. Taking power away from large energy companies, Power Ledger gives local communities the ability to sell their excess solar power to neighbors. Power Ledger has created an energy distribution and tracking platform that allows consumers buy carbonless, sustainable energy at lower prices than what’s offered by traditional electric companies. Power Ledger has plans to expand its operations to three continents worldwide and has amassed an army of powerful strategic partners to help achieve its goals.  With the planned release of multiple applications for its platform in the immediate future, the project has positioned itself to disrupt multiple energy markets throughout the world creating a bright future for all participants involved in this green revolution.","web":"https://powerledger.io/","twt":"PowerLedger_io","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerLedger/","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"FTO","info":{"desc":"FuturoCoin is a cryptocurrency which combines proven solutions with innovative technology. FuturoCoin’s code is extended version of Dash\u0027s code.

Targeting the $47B online gambling market, FunFair isn’t actually a casino. Instead, the underlying gaming technology is licensed out to casinos and other gambling platforms. The FunFair team is attempting to solve some of the biggest problems online casinos face: slow performance, high operating costs, and lack of user trust. Through the use of blockchain technology and Fate Channels, an in-house built version of state channels, the products they license have the potential fix all of them.\r\n\r\nFUN is an ERC-20 token that you use in every part of the FunFair platform. It’s the only token accepted for in-game credits, how game creators in the marketplace are paid, what casinos must pay their licensing with and receive revenues in, and all fees on the platform must be paid in FUN. A total of 11,000,000,000 FUN tokens were created on June 22, 2017, and no more will be created. With a fixed supply, the token is deflationary and should experience sharp increases in price over time as demand for it increases. Furthermore, the FUN that’s paid as fees will be burned for the first two years which should further drive price upwards. Casinos can also stake the FUN tokens in their bankrolls to receive additional dividends.\r\n\r\nThe 30+ person FunFair team is based out of London and is led by Jez San, OBE. San’s entire career has revolved around entrepreneurship and the computer gaming industry. He founded Argonaut Software as a teen and created the first chip to power 3D games like Star Fox and Harry Potter. Rounding out his resume, San also founded the 3D online poker room, PKR, and is an investor in one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken. Other members of the team are just as impressive. Jeremy Longley, founder and CTO, co-founded PKR with San and has over 15 years of experience managing development teams. FunFair COO, David Greyling, was previously the International Director of William Hill – a worldwide betting and gaming company.\r\n\r\nFunFair is attempting to enter the gigantic online gaming market by providing a solution that’s unique to the blockchain industry. Instead of acting as a casino, the company is licensing out their technology to other casinos which helps to mitigate their liability and risk. The project already has a working product and plans to launch early this year. With the wealth of experience that the team has in the gaming space, it’s hard to see this project failing. If FunFair can overcome the market domination of current incumbents using traditional technology, blockchain-based casino games could be the new industry paradigm.","web":"https://funfair.io/","twt":"FunFairTech","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FunfairTech","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"BOAT","info":{"desc":"BOAT is a cryptocurrency in transition.

It is a blockchain platform that supports transactions and data access. It is scalable. Sub-chains and smart contracts are compatible with MOAC. Decentralized apps and cross-chain connections are possible as well. MOAC is based on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e platform, and it uses a ERC20 currency. MOAC offers more including, A layered configuration structure, Asynchronous contract calls, Sharding solutions and Pluggable validation schemes.\r\n\r\nTransactions are processed through several consensus systems. The rate is 100 times faster than current blockchain platforms. Sub-chains increase concurrency rates up to 10,000 times. Sub-chains reduce cost and create a test environment. Cross-chain connections allow users and dApps to migrate to the MOAC platform without any knowledge. There’s also a decentralized file storage system. MOAC uses a Proof-of-Work system that allows miners to mine the main chain and sub-chains. Mining can be done from mobile devices. PoW algorithms deter third-party interference, including denial of service attacks and spamming. Sharding is another notable feature in MOAC. This is a method for allocating processing power. The amount of processing power given is proportional to the number of nodes in the network. Large blockchain shards are divided into groups of small shards that are fast.\r\n\r\nMOAC has lofty ambitions: it uses multichain architecture with microchains built on top of the MOAC base layer. It also plans to enable crosschain atomic swaps between blockchains like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or Ethereum, just like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/komodo\"\u003eKomodo\u003c/a\u003e does. Both intend to do so via sharding. The MOAC testnet launched November 2017, and the MOAC ERC-20 token and wallet were created in February 2018. Mainnet MOAC launched at the end of April 2018 with Ethereum support, and a mainnet explorer is available on the MOAC.io website. Sharding is due for a December 2018 release. Tokenized MOAC transactions occur on the base layer, and sidechains handle smart contracts. Sidechain creators determine their individual consensus model, so traditional models like Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Skill can be used, along with new hybrid models.\r\n\r\nMOAC aims to be the mother of all cryptocurrencies, and its ambitions are backed by one of the strongest technical teams in blockchain. Based in China, the team has experience in blockchain, enterprise IT, and more. MOAC is a Proof-of-Work algorithm whose token started as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. This base layer supports tokenization using other consensus mechanisms. MOAC decentralizes block processing using microchains and a technique called sharding. Microchains are cross-compatible and can soon be made cross-compatible with other chains for atomic swaps. MOAC has a strong community mostly based in China, where it has a strong presence across social media. This community can build it into a strong dApp, tokenization, and exchange platform.","web":"https://moac.io/","twt":"moac_io","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/MOACChain/moac-core"}},{"currencyName":"PARETO","info":{"desc":"The Pareto Network is the first peer to peer financial content marketplace.

It is the first step towards having an unbanked investment world where an independent digital currency asset yields returns in an alternate medium of exchange."}},{"currencyName":"OMG","info":{"desc":"The OMG network is a scaling solution for finance on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e, enabling transparent, peer-to-peer transactions in real-time. The decentralized network facilitates self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes and applications. OmiseGo builds an app with our SDK to enable wallet-to-wallet transactions of crypto and fiat currencies, loyalty points, game credits and more. It uses the OMG network to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on chain. Besides, it offers a decentralized exchange mechanism to provide multi-asset and cross-chain interoperability, that is scalable and secure via \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dProof+of+Stake\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eproof-of-stake\u003c/a\u003e. \r\n\r\nOmiseGO is building a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id\u003d9\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003edecentralized exchange\u003c/a\u003e, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network of validators which enforce behavior of all participants. It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants. This high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from fiat-backed issuers to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and native cryptocurrencies).\r\n\r\nUnlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms, this allows for decentralized exchange of other blockchains and between multiple blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token. Markets may be able to significantly reduce spreads and encourage market assurance via decentralizing custody and increased transparency of market activity. This is achieved using smart contracts, protocol tokens enforcing correct market behavior of orderbook matching, a new construction of Ethereum bonded external enforcement of clearinghouse activity, and commitments to historical exchange data for use with Ethereum smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits such as access. Through the open source, white-label SDK, digital wallet providers can connect to the public OMG network to enable users to transact any digital assets, including crypto and fiat currencies. It has high security because bonding to the Ethereum blockchain creates secure token custody, decentralized exchange of all Ethereum assets, and ultra-secure transaction validation. It is very stable as the Plasma architecture allows for unlimited scalability with unprecedented transaction speed: millions, and potentially billions of transactions per second. \r\n\r\nOmiseGO allows for stakeholders, from individuals to issuers, to have significantly greater assurance in the financial mechanisms of society. With the emerging popularity of eWallet platforms, siloed networks are becoming a problem. This creates a unique opportunity for fiat tokens to interchange across a decentralized network, along with cross compatibility with cryptocurrencies. In order to build this decentralized interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities, as well as incentives around creating well-functioning liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nEventually, these issued tokens may asymptotically get closer and closer to full decentralization (including user-owned keys) which maximizes agency of the individual. This can be achieved by creating not only transparency in the business process of payment interchange, but also removing the ownership of the business process itself from a single trusted entity.\r\n\r\nThe OmiseGo team has already been recognized as up and coming “Fintech Rockstars” by Forbes for their contributions to date. Omise contributed $100,000 in funding to the Ethereum foundation’s DEVGRANTS which is a program to help new Ethereum focused projects, develop the code bases and implement community evangelism. This indicates their commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.This has helped them amass a fairly stacked advisory board. The OmiseGO board lists the co-founders of Ethereum, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\"\u003eGolem\u003c/a\u003e, Tendermint, Cosmos and even the Lightning Network as advisors. That’s quite a justice league of crypto-superstars. \r\n\r\nAlthough many cryptos are focused on disrupting global banking, Omise and OmiseGO are actually following current trends in the banking industry. Their goal is to provide banking to the unbanked, something both PayPal and Stripe are also doing in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/omisego-omg/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for the complete review of OmiseGo.","web":"https://omg.omise.co/","twt":"omise_go","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/omise/omise-magento"}},{"currencyName":"OMX","info":{"desc":"SHIVOM is building the largest genomic and health data hub around the globe by combining blockchain, genomic DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence and cryptography to power secure and personalized medicine. \r\n \r\nEverybody will be able to get their genome sequenced and securely stored, and our ecosystem will offer an open web-marketplace for providers to add their apps and services alongside advanced data analytics.

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE’s platform.\r\n\r\nComposition and Allocation Mechanism of ONE\r\n\r\nONE is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\n【Community-owned part】51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\r\n【BIG token holders owned part】49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\r\nHow to Get ONE?\r\n\r\nTrade cryptos in the “Trade-Mining” section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\r\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the “Trade-Mining” section. As incentive, you will receive 20% of your referred new user’s trading fee rebate in the form of ONEs.\r\nBIG tokens stored on BigONE platform will automatically be airdropped ONEs.\r\nHold ONEs, Share All Platform Trading Fee\r\n\r\nEveryday at 00:00 UTC+8, BigONE will take a snapshot according to the current ONE balance on the platform. All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula \u003d number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\r\n\r\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through “Trade-Mining” or “Referral-Mining” or “Airdrop to BIG token holders” until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\r\n\r\n【Trade-Mining】\r\n\r\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the “Trade-Mining” section. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the platform will calculate all trading fees occurred in the “Trade-mining” section during the last 24 hours (from the previous 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) and unlock equivalent worth of ONEs using the average price of ONE on the same day. On the following day’s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the “Trade-mining” section in the previous day.\r\n\r\n【Referral-Mining】\r\n\r\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform’s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users’ tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user’s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\r\n\r\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\r\n\r\n【Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders】\r\n\r\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders’ according to the formula: [Previous day’s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\r\n\r\n【Friendly Tips】\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new “Trade-mining” rule applies and 100% of BigONE\u0027s revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\r\n\r\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks.

With the use of JavaScript as its application programming language, the platform makes use of relational databases to store data, drawing similarities between developing a DAPP and developing a traditional web application. This type of platform carries a great deal of appeal to developers, as well as small and medium enterprises, since its ease of use results in greater productivity, fuelling and facilitating a more prosperous ecosystem in the process. ASCH is open in design and is not limited to any particular niche market such as news aggregation, the issue of assets, arbitration, the existence of certificate, property rights certification, the Internet of things, supply chain finance, asset digitization, commodity tracing, prepaid card system, block chain contract deposit etc. In terms of the consensus mechanism, ASCH has inherited and enhanced the DPOS algorithm, simultaneously reducing the probability of forking and double spending by a significant degree. Furthermore, ASCH’S side chain, i.e. the application mode, not only improves scalability by delaying the expansion of the block chain, but also makes DAPPS more flexible and personalized. ASCH is a forward-looking, low-cost and one-stop application solution, which is believed to be a new generation of incubator for decentralized applications. Adhering to the values of enterprise accomplishments, innovation leading, technology belief and embracing future, ASCH is devoted to building a global commercial block chain application ecosystem, which is not only using block chain technology to empower various industries, but also being the base of the world class economy.\r\n\r\nThe services provided by the ASCH platform include a public chain and a set of application SDKs; the public chain is called the main chain. The ASCH application SDKs can be used to develop blockchain applications with a free-running, immutable ledger. These applications are also known as side chain applications. An application SDK has a built-in cross-chain protocol, through which the side chain can communicate with the main chain. In other words, the main chain has the function of asset routing, through which a variety of assets can flow among different applications. ASCH’s ecological system contains multiple chains, with each chain possessing the ability to carry multiple tokens or assets. Each token or asset can also be transferred to multiple chains.","web":"http://www.asch.so/","twt":"Asch_Global","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/sqfasd/asch"}},{"currencyName":"XAU","info":{"desc":"Xaucoin (Symbol: XAU) is a virtual token having features similar to Bitcoin, except for its block base of only 2.1 million units.\nXaucoin possesses these following features:\n- PoW SHA-256\n- Bitcoin-Based Economic Model\n- Rare Digital Commodity\n- Gold-like Asset\n- Store of Value\n- 2.1 Million Total Coin Base (Approx)\n- 10 x More Rare than Bitcoin *\nbased on actual total PoW coin base in circulation","web":"N/A","twt":"xau_coin"}},{"currencyName":"VIEW","info":{"desc":"Viewly is a decentralized video platform powered by blockchain and peer‐to‐peer video sharing technologies.

In this way, Counterparty is similar to platforms like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waves\"\u003eWaves\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e. Of course, the difference is Counterparty integrates directly with Bitcoin. Therefore, it comes will all the security and reliability (and issues) that are part of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a fairly old project. In fact, it pre-dates Ethereum with its launch in 2014. It was the original asset creation mechanism. As you’re probably aware, Counterparty has faded from prominence over the years. This is largely due to the rise of the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nWhile we’ve become used to calling blockchain assets, tokens, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. An asset can represent anything that has value or is rare. As a result, Counterparty steers clear of the word “token” in their marketing and documentation. They’re much more interested in digital assets of all kinds, not just currencies, securities, and utility tokens. Digital assets can be a digital marker of a physical object, an easy way to manage shares in your company, or reputation karma for a website. These are all types of assets you could create on Counterparty (or Ethereum or Waves, for that matter). Counterparty creates the set of rules, requirements, integrations, etc that are necessary for assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s the infrastructure behind user-created assets in much the same way that the ERC-20 protocol sets up guidelines and standards for asset creation on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nOne useful function of digital assets is as a marker of ownership or voting rights. Imagine a scenario where you issued a digital asset to each of your company’s board members in proportion to the amount of voting power held. Or if you gave your stockholders a digital asset as a marker of the amount of stock they owned. If you issued your stock asset, you could then use Counterparty’s distribution function to pay out dividends in BTC based on the amount of digital stock asset each person owned.\r\n\r\nCounterparty addresses many of the same issues as Ethereum or Waves, but on the Bitcoin blockchain. While that does come with some advantages, ultimately it is not as strong a platform for development as its competitors. It’s best suited for applications that need to interface with Bitcoin or assets that have a specific connection to the Bitcoin ecosystem.","web":"http://counterparty.io/","twt":"CounterpartyXCP","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/counterparty_xcp/","forum":"https://counterpartytalk.org/","github":"https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib"}},{"currencyName":"XCO","info":{"desc":"","web":"http://x-coin.info/","twt":"XcoinNews","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/jimblasko/xcoin"}},{"currencyName":"XCR","info":{"desc":"Crypti is a node js built crypto currency. "}},{"currencyName":"ORI","info":{"desc":"The Origami Network has created a blockchain-enabled, decentralized marketplace platform to address various problems related to online business platforms such as efficient development, maintenance, payments on escrow, and the management of reviews.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-planned, high-tech platform, with many advanced and functional virtual products.

It was the first blockchain to implement “Turing complete” smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThe most famous application of the smart contracts was a completely decentralized lottery. Estimates towards the end of 2017 calculated for each terabyte of hard drive space you commit to the network, you would mine an average of 21 Burstcoins per week. At the time, there were over 150,000 terabytes of storage devoted to the network. Estimates towards the end of 2017 calculated for each terabyte of hard drive space you commit to the network, you would mine an average of 21 Burstcoins per week. At the time, there were over 150,000 terabytes of storage devoted to the network. The online Burstcoin wallet will also walk you through how to start plotting your hard drive so that you can begin mining right away. Burst is designed to be a miner-friendly coin to ensure decentralization of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWith Bitcoin receiving criticism over wasted energy, Burst offers a more environmentally friendly way to mine and run a decentralized blockchain. If you are looking to mine cryptocurrency but were intimidated by the loud and expensive machines, you might want to check out proof of capacity and consider mining Burstcoin. Or if you simply want a fairly distributed decentralized cryptocurrency with an active development team, then keep your eye on Burstcoin.","web":"https://www.burst-coin.org/","twt":"Burstcoin_dev","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/burstcoin","forum":"https://forums.burst-team.us","github":"https://github.com/PoC-Consortium/engraver"}},{"currencyName":"JUDGE","info":{"desc":"JudgeCoin is a hybrid proof of work and proof of stake alternative crypto currency - the algorithm is X13 and the proof of stake annualised interest rate is 6%. "}},{"currencyName":"ORO","info":{"desc":"Live OroCoin prices from all markets and ORO coin market Capitalization.

Dubbed by its creators as “the first Japanese cryptocurrency,” the coin has become somewhat of Japan’s national alternative to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\"\u003eLitecoin\u003c/a\u003e. Like its predecessors, the coin was created purely to serve as P2P electronic cash, a decentralized digital currency aimed at Japanese citizens. There are a few key differences that set it apart from the coins that came before it, and this guide is dedicated to drawing out these differences. Conceived in December of 2013, Monacoin was officially born on January 1st, 2014 with no premine.\r\n\r\nA Bitcoin Talk Forum on the same date details the coin’s launch and its specifications. A soft fork was executed at block 937440 to implement Segwit, a move made to keep it in line with Bitcoin, Litecoin, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vertcoin\"\u003eVertcoin\u003c/a\u003e, and other payment-focused cryptocurrencies.  In addition, the Monacoin team has reportedly implemented the Lightning Network for their coin. Speaking of soft forks, Monacoin is actually a hard fork of Litecoin, something we’ll take into account further as we look into its specs below. Monacoin was originally founded by the pseudonymous Mr. Wantanabe, no doubt in homage to Bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto.  Besides this pen name, the rest of the coin’s team is completely anonymous, so there’s nothing to report on here. In addition, the project has no visible roadmap on its site or anywhere else online.  The team does seem to stay on top of updates and upgrades, however, as the Segwit and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dLyra2RE\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eLyra2REv2\u003c/a\u003e updates and Lightning Network implementation suggest.\r\n\r\nIt is popular in Japan where it was developed. It Uses Lyra2REv2 and Dark Gravity Wave v3 algorithm to ensure fairer mining opportunities, success rate and difficult levels of mining process respectively. Monacoin is the first cryptocurrency from Japan. It has received wide support and success in the country and is not crossing the national boundary to try and become a global phenomenon. While that is not going to happen in the next year or two, it does have the making of a good crypto token. It is steadily improving its service and has constantly strived to give its users the best possible experience.

It is written in Java and JavaScript with 100% original source code. NEM has a stated goal of a wide distribution model and has introduced new features in blockchain technology in its proof-of-importance (POI) algorithm. NEM also features an integrated P2P secure and encrypted messaging system, multisignature accounts and an Eigentrust++ reputation system.\r\n\r\nEssentially, NEM is designed as a financial blockchain solution and can be used for payment, clearing and settlement in a private environment which is highly controlled. This means that NEM meets several of the regulatory requirements and guidelines in the financial industry. This allows it to be used to settle (change of ownership) any asset via the blockchain. Mijin which is a private chain of NEM has gained popularity and companies such as Hitachi have already embraced it.\r\n\r\nWhy NEM?\r\nMany banks around the world have come to accept the importance of blockchain technology. In fact, a good number of banks in the U.S, India and Japan have already started using the technology. Because banks generally employ the smart contract concept, NEM’s platform which is asset-friendly can be used to settle any asset. In settling assets, speed, security, and reliability are very important to a mainstream institution which is what this crypto offers. NEM addresses these issues by repackaging its blockchain into a private chain and presenting it as Mijin.\r\n\r\nNEM crypto is also applicable in the technology world. Unlike \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\"\u003eDogecoin\u003c/a\u003e which use mining to increase the number of coins, XEM uses something called ‘harvesting’. In this process, blocks are generated and a person is rewarded for work contributed using transaction fees. Every block has a certain number of transactions which attract an unknown amount of fees. This keeps the participants incentivized to continue harvesting. For a blockchain user to be allowed to harvest, one must go through a forging mechanism process called Proof-of-Importance (POI).\r\n\r\nPOI is the algorithm used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user\u0027s importance is determined by how many coins they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, as well as a number of other relevant signals to achieve consensus. POI is different from other initiatives which use a fee-sharing model that does not take into consideration one\u0027s overall support of the network. In proof-of-stake systems a person needs to have large numbers of coins to form a block, but in NEM transactions volume and trust become factors. This was designed to encourage users of NEM to not simply hold XEM but instead actively carry out transactions.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for entering the importance calculation, an account must have at least 10,000 vested XEM. All accounts owning more than 10,000 vested XEM have a non-zero importance score. With a supply of 8,999,999,999 XEM, the theoretical maximum number of accounts with non-zero importance is 899,999. In practice, the number of actual accounts with non-zero importance is not expected to approach the theoretical max due to inequalities in held XEM and also the temporal costs associated with vesting. If NEM becomes very popular, a threshold of 10,000 vested XEM could be undesirable. If necessary, this number could be updated in the future via a hard fork, which is the same procedure for adjusting transaction fees and other parameters related to harvesting.","web":"http://www.nem.io","twt":"nemofficial","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nem","forum":"https://forum.nem.io/","github":"https://github.com/NemProject/nem.core"}},{"currencyName":"XET","info":{"desc":"Eternal Token (XET) is developed with bidirectional exchange between Eternal Coin (XEC).

Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a “card”. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today’s centralized platforms. It’s an “experience layer” for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.","web":"https://cardstack.com/","twt":"cardstack","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardstack","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack-token"}},{"currencyName":"OTX","info":{"desc":"Octanox (Symbol: OTX) is an novel, safe, distributed and low transaction cost payment platform.

Using the Gems Protocol, anyone can tap into the power of scalable micro task workers without needing to worry about task verification, trust, or payments.

The Gems Protocol is comprised of a staking mechanism to ensure task completion, a trust mechanism to track worker integrity, and a payment system to reduce transaction fees. The GEM token, a multi-utility token, fuels the Gems Protocol. Gems uses its token mechanism to enforce the behavior of all participants, instead of being regulated by a single operator.\r\n\r\nGems Protocol, aptly named the Gems Platform. The Gems Platform connects those who want work done (henceforth known as “requesters”) and human workers (henceforth known as “miners”). By using the Gems Protocol, the Gems Platform removes socioeconomic barriers that exist in centralized alternatives (e.g. large fees, market inefficiencies, need for bank accountants, etc.).

For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. The collected fee is then redistributed and added to an inflation pool. This inflation pool releases Lumens at a rate of 1% each year.","web":"https://www.stellar.org/","twt":"stellarorg","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stellar","forum":"https://galactictalk.org/","github":"https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol"}},{"currencyName":"CRYP","info":{"desc":"We are a new privacy coin with very fast transaction speeds","web":"https://crypticcoin.io","twt":"CrypticCoin_io","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/crypticcoin/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/crypticcoinvip/CrypticCoin"}},{"currencyName":"XLR","info":{"desc":"Solaris introduces the fairly distributed and decentralized nature of cryptocurrency","web":"http://www.solariscoin.com/","twt":"SolarisCoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/solarisxlr","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Solaris-Project/Solaris"}},{"currencyName":"SUPER","info":{"desc":"","web":"http://www.supercoin.the-node.net/","twt":"coinsuper","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/supercoin","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"XMC","info":{"desc":"Monero-Classic (XMC) is a hard fork of Monero (XMR), announced on 29th March.

PZ\u0027s message on the website:\r\n\r\nHello, everyone! I\u0027m PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder. Most of you know me because of my efforts and adherence to the ecological development of blockchain industry. In the past few years, I saw Bitcoin community and Litecoin community both fell apart for long time due to different ideas , and the development of main chains was unable to move forward. So I organized Litecoin International Round Table Forum and Bitcoin International Round Table Forum in 2017. The two meetings were very successful. The upgrade of Litecoin and Bitcoin also went on successfully.\r\n\r\nRecently, our team noticed that XMR (Monero), the world’s largest anonymous currency, is about to change the PoW algorithm, and plans to further change it twice within 1 year. As we all know, the reason for this algorithm change is that many companies (BITMAIN, PinIdea, etc.) have developed specialized mining machines for Monero. \r\n\r\nActually, the emergence of specialized mining machine for a cryptocurrency is normal market economy phenomenon. In the 10 years since the cryptocurrency community was born, we have seen the birth of specialized mining machine for Bitcoin. Then there emerged Litecoin, which was expected to be against specialized ASIC mining machines, using script algorithm which was considered to be\"against ASIC\" at that time. While after only two years, there appeared specialized mining machine for Litecoin. We considered about whether to change algorithm to be against specialized ASIC mining machines or not. However, after prudent and serious discussion, we believe that for any kind of valuable algorithm, the emergence of mining machine is only a matter of time. Finally, we made our choice to accept the existence of professional mining machines. Now more and more high-value currencies (algorithms) have respondent specialized ASIC mining machines, which has become a common phenomenon in the industry. \r\n\r\nIs the existence of specialized mining machines completely useless? Obviously, this argument is unfair. The emergence of specialized mining machines will indeed accelerate the rise of problems such as centralization of computational power. But we should be reminded the fact that emergence of professional mining machines will also greatly improve network security. If there are professional mining machines, the events like “Monero was attacked by more than 500,000 botnets” could be avoided. \r\n\r\nWe understand that Monero team expects to stick to the expectations and work of Monero\u0027s “against ASIC mining machine”. For a long time, due to the excellent work of Monero team, XMR and its community have achieved great development, providing much valuable contributions to the entire cryptocurrency community. In the community, many people agree with this hard fork of changing algorithms. However, I feel that there is still a part of people who want to maintain the original algorithm and accept the existence of mining machines. They should be heard and respected. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the two ideas of \"embrace ASIC mining machines\" and \"against ASIC mining machines\" both have their own strengths and weakness. At present, the vigorous development of the global cryptocurrency ecology is precisely due to the emergence of various ideas of different people. The collision of different ideas has brought out the flourishing of various digital currencies. We always believe that the ecological diversity of cryptocurrency community is much conducive to the birth of a more secure, stable, prosperous and beautiful encrypted world. We can, and should, allow these minority of people, who are adhering to a different idea, be given equal opportunities with the majority, and the free market will make its own choices. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we believe that these two thoughts should be given equal opportunities for development. We will make our best efforts to maintain the Monero system before this algorithm change, thereby preserving the fire that gives the ecology more potential for development. At the same time, we also invite developers, mining machine manufacturers, trading platforms, miners, purses, and others in this ecological chain to join us, so that the network ecology can gain more possibilities! \r\n\r\nXMC wallet GUI for Windows: \r\nhttps://github.com/monero-classic/monero-gui/releases/download/v0.1.0.0/monero-classic-wallet-gui.zip\r\nMD5：e6dabd083bbaae95fdb87bc0d4aaf483","web":"http://monero-classic.org/index_en.html","twt":"xmccurrency","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/xmc_official","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/monero-classic/monero"}},{"currencyName":"KRAK","info":{"desc":"Kraken price from all markets and KRAK coin market Capitalization.

Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\"\u003eBytecoin\u003c/a\u003e, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a \u0027stealth address\u0027 is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dCryptonight\"\u003eCryptoNote\u003c/a\u003e?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n","web":"https://getmonero.org","twt":"monero","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/monero","forum":"https://forum.getmonero.org/","github":"https://github.com/monero-project/monero"}},{"currencyName":"GLA","info":{"desc":"","web":"https://gladius.io/","twt":"","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/gladiusio/"}},{"currencyName":"GLD","info":{"desc":"Goldcoin is a digital cryptocurrency based on the Scrypt hashing algorithm.

These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn’t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users.

The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we’re just going to focus on their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events. \r\n\r\nUsers in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia is Gnosis’s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product, so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a beta version in December 2017 but haven’t announced a date for the main net release. The Management Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis’s prediction markets. It’s here that you check your balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.\r\n\r\nGnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren’t minting any additional ones. These are the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL usage over the previous 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe Gnosis team is led by Martin Köppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO).

The hierarchical design of the consensus algorithm allows horizontal scalability in consensus groups.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Architecture\r\nVite splits transactions into transaction pairs according to a \"request-response\" pattern. The writing and verification of transactions are asynchronously decoupled, thereby supporting ultra-high throughput. Inter-contract communications are based on an asynchronous messaging model.\r\n\r\nReactive Contract\r\nMessage-Driven\r\nWith an event-driven architecture, every smart contract is viewed as an independent service. Contracts communicate via messages without sharing state.\r\n\r\nSolidity++\r\nSolidity++’s syntax is compatible with most of that of Solidity. The new syntax supports asynchronous semantics, contract scheduling, and provides a series of standard libraries, such as string manipulation, floating-point operations, basic mathematical operations, containers, sorting, and so on.\r\n\r\nIntegrated Decentralized Ecosystem\r\nEnd-to-end system for value transfer\r\nVite itself is a decentralized exchange that supports digital asset issuance, cross-chain value transmission, and inter-token transactions based on the Loopring protocol.

The system is made up of the combined power of user’s machines from personal PCs to entire datacenters. Golem is able to compute almost any tasks from CGI rendering through machine learning to scientific learning. It utilizes an \u003ca href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eethereum\u003c/a\u003e-based transaction system to clear payments between providers, requestors and software developers however it is safe because all computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the hosts’ systems. \r\n\r\nThe company released Brass in 2016 which includes Blender and LuxRender which are the two tools for CGI rendering. There are three releases that follows which are Clay, Stone and Iron. Golem has recently updated their Brass Beta and the highlight of this upgrade are the streamlined task creation GUI, the support for partial task restart in case of subtask timeouts and the fix that should alleviate the issues with the Docker service on Windows. Other than that, improvements have been made on the Blender verification and transaction tracking subsystems and fixed some minor pain-points in the UX. Transaction history will become more user-friendly with separate tabs for payments and incomes. Apart from that, improvements are made for requestors as well, requestors is now able to add resource file without having to repeat the task creation procedure if they have forgotten to add them beforehand. \r\n\r\nGrand vision and core features\r\n● Golem is the first truly decentralized supercomputer, creating a global market for computing power. Combined with flexible tools to aid developers in securely distributing and monetizing their software, Golem altogether changes the way compute tasks are organized and executed. By powering decentralized microservices and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for future Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\n● Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users (\"requestors\") to rent resources of other users’ (\"providers\") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem’s built-in feature set is a dedicated \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id\u003d279\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eEthereum-based\u003c/a\u003e transaction system, which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.\r\n\r\n● The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power can be considered both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is free to create and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry. Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize the payment mechanism resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/golem-gnt/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for the full review of Golem.","web":"https://golem.network/","twt":"golemproject","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject","forum":"https://blog.golemproject.net/","github":"https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron"}},{"currencyName":"XPD","info":{"desc":"The First Cryptocurrency For The Oil Market","web":"","twt":"thepetrodollar","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/bryceweiner/petrodollar"}},{"currencyName":"ICOB","info":{"desc":"As a kind of digital currency, ICOBID (Symbol: ICOB) is created for fueling ICOBID system.

Unfortunately, the website for the POSWallet was hacked, resulting in the team leaving the project. Instead of completely abandoning it, the developers rebuilt the blockchain from the ground up with better features and have now migrated POSW to the superior XSN.\r\n\r\nThe digital coin that powers the Stakenet platform is XSN. It features completely secure Trustless Proof of Stake and is compatible with the Lightning Network, which allows for instant transactions with little to no fees associated with them. XSN will be used to pay for any services on the platform. It can interact with other coins, which will make for many amazing opportunities for investors utilizing the program.

Groestlcoin is strictly a cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer (p2p) payments. The coin serves the same end-goal as other transactional cryptos like Bitcoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\"\u003eLitecoin\u003c/a\u003e but accomplishes that goal with a different set of attributes.\r\n\r\nGroestlcoin accomplished a few significant “firsts” with its feature set. It was the first coin to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the first to perform a Lightning Network transaction on mainnet. With the implementation of the Lightning Network, Groestlcoin has minimal fees. Transferring 10,000 GRS (~$6000 at the time of this writing) costs fractions of a fraction of a cent. Even if the GRS price rises 1000x, the transaction fee would be just a couple of pennies. Groestlcoin utilizes two rounds of Grøstl-512 for its mining algorithm. This mining algo is ASIC-resistant, for now.\r\n\r\nA developer going by the Bitcointalk username “Gruve_P” launched Groestlcoin on March 22, 2014. Since then, the team has grown to over 20 people spread all around the world. Most team members prefer to stay relatively anonymous, only sharing their first name and country of origin on the website. The team has been consistent in releasing new versions of the platform every three months. With such consistency, it shouldn’t shock you to hear all that they’ve accomplished in the last four years. The team activated SegWit in January 2017 and is currently working on Lightning Network releases for both their mobile and desktop wallets. The team and community have also built eleven different Android wallets, ten different wallets for Blackberry, and three for iOS. They’ve created more than ten desktop wallets as well.\r\n\r\nGRS has recently seen a rise in popularity, with most CPU and GPU miners moving away from networks like BTC, where ASIC miners have completely saturated the mining pool. With its robust features, focus on privacy, and innovative technology, GRS is a very lucrative choice for these miners, and has the possibility to be the next big coin that hits the market.

It is a smart contract platform which is does not involve in mining Tezos coins. It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.\r\n\r\nThe source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos’ proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dDelegated+Proof-of-Stake\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003edelegated proof-of-stake (dPOS)\u003c/a\u003e where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called “baking”. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nBaking \u0026 Endorsing\r\nBaking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 10,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 16 XTZ for baking a block.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 2 XTZ for each block they endorse.\r\n\r\nBlock Rewards \u0026 Inflation\r\nBlock rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. Currently, 38% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is currently 14%.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network.

The reason it was created was to create a truly private cryptocurrency. The founder of Verge felt that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e wasn’t anonymous, so he decided to build a new blockchain where transactions could not be traced. Verge uses multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of the users are fully obfuscated. The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration as well as SSL encryption which adds an extra level of security.\r\n\r\nVerge is an open source project with an active team of developers from all over the world. The development team is always in close contact with the community. Verge is not a private company funded through an ICO or premining. Wraith Protocol is a technology upgrade package that enables our users to be able to send and receive payments privately across our blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services.   Additionally this update removes our QT wallet users off of clearnet and migrates everyone to SSL enabled Tor.\r\n\r\nVerge focuses on security and maintaining user anonymity just like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\"\u003eMonero\u003c/a\u003e; so that is its latent upside. Many investors are also applauding its unique technology. Having been improved and integrated with the Wraith Protocol technology, verge users are now able to effortlessly switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.\r\n\r\nBefore this, private and public ledgers were mutually selected, meaning that they could not co-exist on a very similar blockchain. But investors are today free to use whatever ledger they want. A good example was when Wraith Protocol switched ON – one will not be able to view the transaction data, not even via the blockchain explorer. Additionally, Verge makes obscure the IP addresses in both instances. When coupled with Wraith Protocol Verge certainly becomes the only undetectable cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, transaction speed on Verge is light speed at 5 seconds only, using Simple Payment Verification technology. Verge also maintains a community feel since it’s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nVerges offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining. They include; Lyra2rev2, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dScrypt\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eScrypt\u003c/a\u003e, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl. Offering a choice of five different algorithms promotes inclusion, since a wider variety of users will now have an opportunity to not only mine but influence the network. Should one algorithm demand greater mining resources, users get an option of just switching to a different one.","web":"http://vergecurrency.com/","twt":"vergecurrency","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge"}},{"currencyName":"XVP","info":{"desc":"Virtacoinplus is an X11 cryptocurrency that was previously Virtacoin, PayBox.me and VirtaPay.

To achieve this privacy and anonymity, Zcoin uses zero-knowledge proofs via Zerocoin protocol which is one of the most cited cryptography papers at this point in time. In other words, when you transact using  \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e or something similar, your transaction history is always linked to your coins by default which makes you vulnerable. That, because all it takes is one link to your personal information or IP to find out the origin of the coins.However, if you transact using Zcoin’s Zerocoin feature, none of your transaction histories is linked to the actual coins and only the receiver and sender know that you have actually exchanged funds.\r\n\r\nZerocoin is a cryptocurrency proposed by Johns Hopkins University professor Matthew D. Green and graduate students Ian Miers and Christina Garman as an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that would add true cryptographic anonymity to Bitcoin transactions. Zerocoin was first implemented into a fully functional cryptocurrency released to the public by Poramin Insom, as Zcoin who is also the lead developer, in September 2016. At the initial stage, Zcoin uses the Lyra2z algorithm for proof of work, then they will transition to a Merkle Tree proof of work algorithm, known as MTP. MTP is a unique memory hard algorithm that aims to solve several problems. Memory hard algorithms help prevent the development of ASICs which lead to centralized mining farms. \r\n\r\nMemory hard algorithms also prevent the use of botnets infecting computers for mining purposes. If a botnet was using up multiple gigs of memory, you’d be likely to notice something is wrong. “The basic concept is that it should establish the same price/cost for a single computation unit on all platforms meaning that there is no single device that should gain a significant advantage over another for the same price hence promoting egalitarian computing.","web":"https://zcoin.io","twt":"zcoinofficial","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zcoin","forum":"https://zcoin.io/blog/","github":"https://github.com/zcoinofficial/electrumx"}},{"currencyName":"SIFT","info":{"desc":"Smart Investment Fund is a new high dividend yield crypto asset investment and trading fund that will trade blockchain assets using a proprietary method of financial trading called Smart Volume Analysis (Smart VSA)","web":"https://smartift.com/","twt":"smartift","reddit":"","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/smartift/smartift-contract"}},{"currencyName":"GXS","info":{"desc":"From the developers at Gongxinbao (GXB) comes GXChain, a public blockchain that offers decentralized data exchange solutions, being the first exchange of its kind in the world.

TOR increases the amount of privacy for cryptocurrency users and reduces the possibilities of being attacked or hacked by other illegal or legal entities. With the help of DeepOnion, you can easily receive and send ONIONs (the cryptocurrency of the DeepOnion blockchain) over the TOR network. The blockchain ensures anonymity and can also be used to receive or send personal transactions with the help if Deepcoin wallet. DeepOnion has just one major goal, that is, to protect the privacy and identity of the users by making a payment platform that is secure, scalable, instantaneous, untraceable, and anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe DeepOnion coin was launched in July 2017. Its 40 rounds of airdrops, where the coins were distributed for free, helped the currency to get recognized in the market. DeepOnion has also established its partnerships with multiple privacy services such as Bisq P2P DEX, and with other online marketplaces. The blockchain uses both, Proof of Stake and Proof of Work algorithms. The TOR network powering DeepOnion ensures anonymity and security of peer-to-peer connections. There are few countries which have blocked the access to TOR browser. In order to solve this, DeepOnion had released protocols for bypassing the issue.\r\n\r\nThe Onion Routing (TOR) is a technology that is used to ensure anonymity over the internet. The messages on the ONION network are encapsulated in multiple layers of encryption, just like the layers of an onion. This encrypted data is further sent through a series of network nodes which are known as onion routers. Each of this peels away a single layer that uncovers the next destination of the data. Stealth addresses help to prevent public connection of an output of the transaction with a recipient’s wallet address. They also conceal the destination address of a transaction, thereby hiding the identity of the receiver on the network of the DeepOnion cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nOne reason that can contribute in the rise of ONION is that the coin provides 100% anonymity with TOR technology. It keeps funds of its users safe from government and hackers. The private transactions, which has also been the backlog of various other cryptocurrencies has been fulfilled by DeepOnion. Another reason that will help ONION rise is because it requires less time for making or receiving payments.\r\n\r\nEven though ONION has outstanding as well as unique features, it still has a global ranking beyond 300, which means that it still has a long way to make to the list of top cryptocurrencies. The coin is still being overlooked due to other major digital currencies.","web":"https://deeponion.org/","twt":"GetDeepOnion","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepOnion","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion"}},{"currencyName":"PLR","info":{"desc":"The Pillar Project is a collaboration of the blockchain innovation community of 20|30.

It is responsible for inventing proof-of-stake consensus, which makes it the first efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. Peercoin was inspired by \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003ebitcoin\u003c/a\u003e, and it shares much of the source code and technical implementation of bitcoin. The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license. Unlike bitcoin, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/namecoin\"\u003eNamecoin\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\"\u003eLitecoin\u003c/a\u003e, Peercoin does not have a hard limit on the number of possible coins, but is designed to eventually attain an annual inflation rate of 1%. There is a deflationary aspect to Peercoin as the transaction fee of 0.01 PPC/kb paid to the network is destroyed. This feature, along with increased energy efficiency, aim to allow for greater long-term scalability.\r\n\r\nWith the same encryption algorithm as Bitcoin (SHA-256), Peercoin is 100 times more energy efficient. Transactions in the Peercoin network are faster and cheaper. If there were not fierce competition on the cryptocurrency market, Peercoin would probably have long since become one of the most important cryptocurrencies. But in 2014 and 2015, however, there were many other interesting innovations in the cryptocurrency market that outperformed peercoin in a number of important properties. In contrast to DASH, Peercoin could not offer anonymity and the transactions in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\"\u003eDogecoin\u003c/a\u003e were even faster and cheaper than those of Peercoin. PoS technology ceased to be an advantage of peercoin and PoS continued to spread to other cryptocurrencies. The interest of the users drew it to the side of the minings on the CPUs and GPUs, then to the side of the Smart Contracts and PPC began to get a little forgotten. \r\n\r\nThe Peercoin Team believes that adapting blockchains for wide scale use only through on-chain transactions will negatively affect the decentralization level and security of the network over time, therefore we choose to develop the Peercoin blockchain as a base layer settlement network with a sole focus on securing all forms of value recorded into the chain. This can be accomplished through Peercoin\u0027s philosophy of preserving and maximizing decentralization (which increases security) by developing the majority of features and technologies on top of the blockchain, rather than directly into the blockchain protocol itself.\r\n\r\nThus the Peercoin Team focuses on developing second layer protocols and sub-networks that can interact with the base layer blockchain to adapt it for wide scale use and improve functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing. In this way, Peercoin will act as a secure and censorship resistant base layer for the future blockchain connected world.","web":"http://www.peercoin.net","twt":"peercoinppc","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/peercoin","forum":"https://talk.peercoin.net/","github":"https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin"}},{"currencyName":"AMIS","info":{"desc":"AMIS (Symbol: AMIS) is an ERC20 currency that is the first Asset Management Instrument solution vehicle created on the Ethereum blockchain.

They then kicked off their public ICO on February 28, 2018 and by the end of the ICO on March 7, 2018, they had met their goal of $30,000,000 USD. Synthetix was \u003ca href\u003d\"https://blog.havven.io/havven-is-transforming-into-synthetix-2fdf727b8892\"\u003erebranded\u003c/a\u003e from Havven on November 30, 2018.\r\n\r\nSynthetix is led by a multidisciplinary team of 13 individuals. The project was founded by Kain Warwick, who previously co-founded blueshyft, one of the largest digital payment networks in Australia. The CTO is Justin Moses, who also serves as the Director of Engineering at MongoDB. Synthetix aims to address the problem that companies running centralized payment networks such as PayPal, credit card networks, or the SWIFT banking network have “absolute control over the value within the network, so any transaction conducted within them may be blocked or reversed at any time.” According to the Synthetix white paper, “Although this is ostensibly designed to protect users, it introduces systemic risk for all participants. If the network is compromised or its owners cease to behave benevolently, no party can trust that the value in their account is secure or accessible.”\r\n\r\nThis is theorized to work because anyone who holds SNX tokens in escrow will be incentivized by Synthetix rewards derived from network transaction fees that will be distributed “in proportion with how well each issuer maintains the correct Synths supply.” When a Synthetix escrow user puts their SNX in escrow, USD-stabilized Synths will be automatically put up for sale on a decentralized exchange at a price of $1 USD. To release escrowed SNX, the user must buy back the Synths issued (also at a price of $1 USD) at which point the Synths will be burned. The Synthetix system uses an algorithm to adjust network fees, and therefore dividends, to SNX holders to incentivize (or disincentivize) the holding of SNX in escrow smart contracts, and thus, the creation of Synths. The theory is that this will cause users to mint and burn Synths in the appropriate amount based solely on supply and demand.","web":"https://www.synthetix.io/","twt":"synthetix_io","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/havven/","forum":"https://blog.havven.io/","github":"https://github.com/havven/havven"}},{"currencyName":"PRA","info":{"desc":"Prochain next-gen decentralized digital advertising ecosystem.

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\r\n\r\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e whitepaper was written.

Hashpower will base on the technical characteristic to build a decentralized hash power resource shared platform which is open, fair, transparent and covenant-lite for users and provide better service connected with rich industry experience for global users at the same time. Based on the hash power system with open source and its own mining infrastructure, hash power Coin has provided node users around the world with mine construction, power lease, mine operation, equipment procurement, computational investment, digital asset trading, circulation, exchange and other services.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the mining costs, such as the use of big data, cloud mining, CDN network of the entire network of computer room networks, hash power contract mechanism, the more nation-wide mining services based on HPC digital assets has been constructed. The basic logic is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Low-cost electricity power resources control is uesd to ensure steady earnings of project investment.\r\nCurrently, mining digital currencies in blockchain requires a lot of resources, especially electric power resources. Too much consumption has caused policy makers in many countries to take drastic measures against mining. Hash power Coin estimated the electric power cost of many countries, and finally selected the United States, Russia, and Sweden as the preferred overseas layout countries, and guaranteed steady earnings of project investment by controlling low-cost electric power resource channels.\r\n\r\n2. Layout in multiple countries to avoid policy risks of single country\r\nBlockchain as an emerging technology, each country has invested a lot of enthusiasm to the blockchain, however, different countries have shown different attitudes to the digital currency of the blockchain and formulated different policies, both of which are unstable. Hash power Coin took into account the legal risks involved and adopted a multinational development strategy to avoid the risk of project termination arising from a country’s policies. We have 3 million square meters of factory buildings to transform and build the machine room in Russia, and have met the indicators of natural gas power generation, so we can generate electricity for own use with 1.4 million kilowatts, the power plant now has 300,000 kilowatts of natural gas.\r\n\r\n3. Multi-modal mining investment combines POW hash power layout with POS node layout \r\nAt present, there are two mining modes—POW hash power layout and POS node layout. POW algorithm is proof of work algorithm. The proof of work is from the economics, which is an effective economic strategy proposed by two economists firstly in 1993 to prevent the abuse of services or resources. This type of hash power layout method rewards miners based on their contribution to mining, while the latter, POS node. layout is a model generates a new digital asset for the node based on the amount and time of the digital asset that the node holds. Hash power Coin provides mining services with ASIC, GPU, CPU, lPFS, and CDN bandwidth mining. Users can independently select the mining model through the hash power Coin. At the same time, hash power Coin plans to lay out ETH nodes in advance and will provide users with ETH-to-POS services in the future.\r\n\r\n4.Network of core labs\r\nHash power Coin adopts the network of core labs. Local cache acceleration is set up in different regions, which improves the access speed of different nodes and greatly improves the stability of the above mining nodes. Anti-attack cluster, with widely distributed CDN nodes and intelligent redundancy mechanisms between nodes, effectively prevents hackers from invading and reduces the impact of various D.D.o.S attacks\r\non websites, while ensuring better service quality.\r\n\r\n5. Computing power trading platform docking the main mining pool and mine field.\r\nHash power Coin solves the practical problems of mining and opens up the road between ordinary users and high-quality mine fields, so that more ordinary users can enjoy the benefits of increased hash power. The hash power trading platform of hash power Coin is easy to operate and safe, enabling more people interested in the blockchain to participate in the global digital asset allocation and get diversified difital assets in return.\r\n\r\n6.Hash power contract\r\nWith the improvement of the blockchain of mainstream digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the mining power is becoming more and more concentrated, and the difficulty in mining is increasing. It is under this background that the hash power Coin came into being. Therefore, intuitively speaking, the hash power Coin is a cloud hash power contract for miners, especially small and medium-sized miners, or for those who lack the infrastructure for mining digital currency. The so- called cloud hash power contract is the transformation of traditional single node mining behavior into joint mining, it eliminates a series of tedious deployments of mining, the purchase of a force contract is equal to the purchase of computing power. Mining can be achieved quickly and easily, and holding a contract represents owning a share of cloud hash power in the entire project. Users can obtain the corresponding digital assets generated by mining in accordance with their own hash power contracts. In addition, through interchange of the HPC digital assets that are originally from hash power Coin, the participants can transfer or exchange contracts, and choose to participate in or withdraw from the project according to the voluntary principle.","web":"http://hashpower.vip","twt":"power_hash","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"HPB","info":{"desc":"HPB (High-Performance Blockchain) is a new kind of block chain hardware and software architecture, which includes a chip acceleration engine and the blockchain platform, aiming to realize the performance extension of distributed applications.

The team believes that TrueUSD will be able to come up with the stable trading instrument for the traders of cryptocurrency that has been long-awaited. This will allow the businesses and consumers to use the digital currency as a medium of an exchange. The goal of the TrueUSD team was to build a coin that is stable and which can be used and trusted by them too. TrustToken is a platform that creates the tokens backed by assets that can easily be purchased and sold all around the world. The first asset token of TrustToken is TrueUSD, which is a stable coin and can be redeemed 1-for-1 for US dollars. TrustToken have partnered with registered fiduciaries and banks for holding the funds securely backed by TrueUSD tokens. To increase the amount of security, fiduciaries, and banks directly handle all the funds. Escrowed funds do not give access to the TrueUSD system.\r\n\r\nTrueUSD works with various trust companies which already manage around billions of dollars. Just pass an AML/KYC check, send USD to a trust company with an agreement of escrow. When the funds get verified, their API tells the smart contract of TUSD to mint an equal amount of TUSD to your public \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e address.\r\n\r\nThe USD funds are regularly verified in scheduled attestations by a very much trusted auditing firm. USD funds are kept safely in a third party account, that is escrow accounts, wherein TrustToken does not hold any direct access to the funds and cannot abscond with them even if they wish to. The token burning and minting system makes sure that every TUSD token is backed by 1 USD.\r\n\r\nA mandatory check of AML/KYC makes sure that TUSD keeps shady people away from the entire project. TUSD makes faster transactions in low transaction fees. Even though TUSD is a unique offering, it is most likely overshadowed by its bigger competitors - Tether. While TUSD arguably offers more security and features, it may be losing the marketing battle. This is not to say that the situation will remain the same.

ETHLend strives to break through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. ETHLend also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn’t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, ETHLend has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a ‘My Loan’ section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n","web":"https://ethlend.io/en/","twt":"ethlend1","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHLend","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/ETHLend/DAPP"}},{"currencyName":"HUC","info":{"desc":"Huntercoin is a cryptocurrency which incorporates Human Mining.

It prioritizes privacy and fast transaction times, with the goal of achieving merchant adoption. The project’s defining feature is its distrust of central authority, even forgoing a Foundation or core team. The currency’s characteristics are similar to Dash in that it seeks to gain mass adoption with a fast, private currency. The major difference is that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dash\"\u003eDash\u003c/a\u003e is seen as a somewhat centralized currency with its use of masternodes and reliance on the Dash Foundation. SmartCash hopes to avoid to avoid the idea of Foundations, core teams, or centralized mining.\r\n\r\nSmartCash proposes a governance model inspired by the ways ants and bees self-organize. The idea is to create a hive, where individuals can contribute to clear projects on small teams. There’s an argument to be made that this uncoordinated model might end up becoming more inefficient than the Foundation/core team model it seeks to replace. However, the community believes self-governing teams can be more nimble and efficient than guided development. Every holder of SMART tokens will be entitled to voting rights. 1 token \u003d 1 vote. This so-called SmartVoting will allow anyone to submit proposals to the hive for consideration and voting. The goal is a bottom-up management structure where projects receive funding from the SmartHive fund and hive members receive payment for completing those proposals. SmartHive is the lifeblood of the project, and it’s intended to govern the project indefinitely.\r\n\r\nSmartRewards encourage long term holding of SMART tokens. As such, it’s a price stabilizing mechanism, decreasing the trading volume and therefore the volatility of SMART. Each wallet that holds more than 1000 SMART will get paid a reward for holding that SMART over a 30 day period. The SmartRewards pay on the 25th of every month. If you’ve held 1000 SMART for over a month, you’ll receive a reward for not spending those tokens. The reward comes from the block reward allocation. To be counted, you’ll need to move 1000 SMART to a single address before the 25th of the current month. If you do, then you’ll receive your reward on the 25th of the following month.\r\n\r\nThe SmartCash source code began as a fork of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcoin\"\u003eZcoin\u003c/a\u003e, using the zerocash protocol. Zerocash is the foundation for the privacy coin \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\"\u003eZcash\u003c/a\u003e. It depends on zero-knowledge proofs to confirm transactions without sharing the sender, recipient, or amount of the transaction. SmartCash uses a Keccak mining algorithm. It’s known to be ASIC-resistant, therefore promoting decentralization of mining capacity. On average, the block reward is around 101.8 SMART, and the block time is 54 seconds. As of March 2018, the mining network had over 17TH/s of mining capacity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, SmartCash has 15 projects funded through its SmartHive governance model. Another 6 projects have already completed successfully. In total, they account for $3.2 million in funded development projects (equivalent in SMART). The top development priorities are InstantPay, cards and readers for payment in stores, an electrum wallet, faster syncing, and an upgraded block explorer. Mobile wallets, atomic swaps, and BIP47 privacy features are also under development.\r\n\r\nThe network applies Keccak mining algorithm, which supports decentralized mining as it is ASIC-resistant.

Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\r\n\r\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\r\n\r\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\r\n\r\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\r\n\r\n5.

The set of links among units forms a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dDirected+Acyclic+Graph+%28DAG%29\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eDAG (directed acyclic graph)\u003c/a\u003e. There is an internal currency called ‘bytes’ that is used to pay for adding data into the decentralized database. Other currencies (assets) can also be freely issued by anyone to represent property rights, debt, shares, etc. Users can send both bytes and other currencies to each other to pay for goods/services or to exchange one currency for another; the transactions that move the value are added to the database as storage units.\r\n\r\nIn Byteball, you must pay a commission using a currency called “Bytes” to add data into the database. The name of Byteball’s currency directly reflects its value. Extremely intuitive, the number of Bytes you pay to add data to the database corresponds directly to the data size of your transaction. For instance, your commission fee to add 1 Kb of data would be 1,000 Bytes. Commission fees create a consistent system of value transfer that aligns the interests of all Byteball’s stakeholders. It also prevents users from spamming useless messages to the database. In addition to payment for storage fees, you can pay Bytes directly to other users for goods or services. Byteball has a second currency that can be used on its platform – Blackbytes. Unlike Byte transactions that are completely visible on the DAG, Blackbytes are significantly less traceable. Blackbyte data is not recorded in the public database; Instead, the transaction data is sent directly peer to peer.\r\n\r\nMade up of a small team of less then five members, Byteball is lead by its founder and lead developer, Anton Churyumov. Churyumov has extensive executive experience in the tech sector as he is co-founder and CEO of Teddy ID as well as co-founder and CIO of Platron. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Churyumov owns SMS Traffic, a Russian technology company that offers solutions and marketing for banks, insurance, and retail firms. Attending Moscow Engineering Physics Institue from 1991 to 1997, Churyumov received his degree in Theoretical Physics.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of Byteball is identity verification. Every Byteball user can link their Byteball address to their real-world identity. Byteball has partnered with Jumio, the leading provider of identity verification services, in order to verify its users’ identities. Once verified, a user’s personal data is securely stored directly in their wallet. At the same time, a hash of the personal data is stored on the public DAG and signed by a trusted attestor. This feature allows Byteball users to decide what to disclose and to whom. When you want to disclose your identity to a service provider, you just pull it out of your wallet in a few clicks. This is useful when participating in ICOs, for example.\r\n\r\nThere aren’t many other cryptocurrency platforms built using DAG technology out there, so Byteball doesn’t really have many competitors. However, the biggest DAG-based platform is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iota\"\u003eIOTA\u003c/a\u003e, and they are currently much more popular and successful than Byteball. That said, Byteball and IOTA are different platforms with different focuses, so they shouldn’t really be considered direct competitors. Right now, the main challenge for Byteball is to gain more popularity and adoption. It’s still a pretty obscure cryptocurrency platform. First and foremost, Byteball will have to up their marketing game so more people know who they are and what they do. The technology and features are solid, so once they gain more exposure, Byteball could potentially become incredibly popular.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-byteball-cryptocurrency-with-no-blockchain/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for the complete review of Byteball.","web":"https://byteball.org/","twt":"ByteballOrg","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteBall/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/byteball/byteballcore"}},{"currencyName":"FLUZ","info":{"desc":"Tradability of your seat through token model on Ethereum blockchain.

It claims to be a “future-proof” cryptocurrency which enables transactions and decentralized communication while providing protection against classical as well as quantum computer attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Resistant Ledger company was founded by Peter Waterland, who found that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum signatures are susceptible to attacks by powerful quantum computers. His research on quantum computers and signature programs let to the development of this new cryptocurrency, designed to be resistant to the present classical attacks as well as any future quantum computer attacks. Their team is made up of a diverse range of members spread out across the world, including developers (core, blockchain, mobile developers, etc.), analysts, advisors, marketing managers, designers and more.\r\n\r\nQuantum Resistant Ledger is the first ever cryptocurrency and the only one in existence as of August 2018, to consider the threat that the future technology of quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies and their working. It uses a technology specifically designed for post-quantum security, called XMSS, which makes it secure against powerful quantum computers even while using a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Security against cyber-attacks is a very serious concern in this digital age, especially when you have digital assets whose loss is likely to lead you to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nQRL is the first blockchain technology that provides durability and stability through resistance to quantum computer attacks. The encryption methods used by modern blockchains can become vulnerable to quantum computers over the next ten years. QRL tries to create a blockchain with long-term stability.

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.\r\n\r\nZcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core\u0027s battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-zcash/\"\u003eCoinBureau\u003c/a\u003e for guide on What is ZCash.","web":"https://z.cash/","twt":"zcashco","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec","forum":"https://forum.z.cash/","github":"https://github.com/zcash/zips"}},{"currencyName":"TEAM","info":{"desc":"TokenStars is the first celebrity management platform on the blockchain, providing advanced tools and incentives for deeper interaction between stars, fans and advertisers.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully started with the ​​ACE ​token sale for tennis ($4.9M+ raised as of the sale end date; ACE is listed on OKEx, a top-10 digital asset trading platform), ​TokenStars has enhanced its team with top-notch experts and stars to launch the TEAM token for the rest of the sports and entertainment verticals: Lothar Matthäus, Gianluca Zambrotta, Valery Karpin (football), Tommy Haas, Robin Söderling, Cedric Pioline, Anastasia Myskina (tennis), Nikita Kucherov (hockey), Alexander Anter (poker) and Rico Torres (Hollywood) are among the celebrities supporting TokenStars.\r\n\r\nThe first module of the platform was launched in December 2017, powering the Crypto Charity Auction to which many worldwide famous celebrities donated their personal items with signatures.","web":"https://tokenstars.com/team","twt":"tokenstars","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TokenStars/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/tokenstars/SolidityAuction"}},{"currencyName":"ICX","info":{"desc":"ICON is a blockchain technology and network framework designed to allow independent blockchains to interact with each other.

Theta is an open source protocol purpose-built to power the decentralized streaming network and will allow for vertical decentralized apps (DApps) to be built on top of the platform to enable esports, music, TV/movies, education, enterprise conferencing, peer-to-peer streaming, and more. SLIVER.tv’s DApp will be the first application built on the Theta network leveraging its existing user base of millions of esports viewers.\r\n\r\nDSN and the Theta protocol solve various challenges the video streaming industry faces today. First, Theta tokens are used as an incentive to encourage individual users to share their redundant memory and bandwidth resources as caching nodes for video streams. This improves the quality of stream delivery and solves the “last-mile” delivery problem, the main bottleneck for traditional stream delivery pipelines, especially for high resolution high bitrate 360° virtual reality (VR) streams. Second, with sufficient amount of caching nodes, the majority of viewers will pull streams from peering caching nodes. This significantly reduces content delivery network (CDN) bandwidth costs, which is a major concern for video streaming sites.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Theta network greatly improves the streaming market efficiency by streamlining the video delivery process. For example, advertisers can target end viewers at a lower cost and reward influencers more transparently.The Theta blockchain introduces three novel concepts: Reputation Dependent Mining: In the Theta protocol, the caching nodes play the role of miners in the blockchain. The block reward is not a constant, but depends on the reputation score of the caching node that mined the block. To obtain more mining rewards, miners not only spend computation power to mine blocks, but also relay video streams to downstream viewers to increase their reputation scores.\r\n\r\nGlobal Reputation Consensus: We propose a mechanism for the Theta network to reach the global consensus on the reputation scores for each caching node. Proof-of-Engagement: We introduce a novel Proof-of-Engagement scheme to prove that viewers legitimately consume the video streams, providing better transparency to advertisers and a basis for viewers to earn Theta tokens for engaging with the content.","web":"https://www.thetatoken.org/","twt":"thetatoken","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thetatoken","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-protocol-delivery-lib"}},{"currencyName":"IMVR","info":{"desc":"ImmVRse is a marketplace for content creators, where brands will be able to hire them on the platform and content sharing platform for VR users and enthusiasts.

The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.\r\n\r\nZilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too.\r\n\r\nZiliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans.

It allows decentralized applications (Dapps) of all sorts to be built within a secure, highly-scalable environment and be integrated directly into Particl’s flagship wallet: Particl Desktop\r\n\r\nParticl\u0027s mission is to foster a new decentralized, private and democratic economy supported by its platform and native currency (PART). All the fees generated by the platform are paid to the PART coin holders who are securing the network.\r\n\r\nPART is a privacy coin built from the Bitcoin Core codebase and is always updated to its latest version (currently 0.16.0). Capitalizing on the latest Bitcoin codebase not only allows the Particl platform to benefit from both Bitcoin’s stability and security, but also enables developers to leverage and easily fork any product, service and technology development from the Bitcoin developer community.\r\n          \r\nParticl Cold Staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins. In other words, it allows users to stake offline coins.\r\n\r\nParticl\u0027s decentralized marketplace is built with privacy at its core and offers a low-cost, secure and scalable e-commerce experience. Designed to work with almost any coin, it uses several privacy-enhancing features such as default private transactions, encrypted data, secure messaging, IP address anonymization, metadata stripping, private listings and more. It is exclusively governed by the Particl community which also earns all the fees generated by the marketplace.\r\n\r\nParticl is designed so that users can easily use and build decentralized applications that can then be integrated directly into Particl Desktop. These applications foster the decentralized, private and trustless Particl economy and are built using native privacy smart-contracts.\r\n\r\nPART can be sent as three different privacy states, each with their own degree of privacy and cost: Public, Blind, Anonymous. Each state has a purpose within our privacy platform and also provides the user full control of the linkability and traceability of their transactions. Particl is the first coin in history to deploy these privacy protocols on a Bitcoin Core codebase.\r\n\r\nThe Particl platform accepts a wide range of cryptocurrencies and provides maximum privacy at the same time. By using atomic swaps and third-party integrations, all incoming currency transactions are automatically converted into PART, Particl’s native currency. This way, you can use your favorite cryptocurrency while being protected by PART’s powerful privacy features.","web":"http://particl.io/","twt":"particlproject","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/particl/particl-market"}},{"currencyName":"IOC","info":{"desc":"I/O Coin (Input/Output Coin) is a cryptocurrency designed for mass market and merchant adoption.

Alongside ION, Economy, a digital entertainment platform for gamers and game developers was also launched in April 2016. ION is based mostly on the idea of making it easier for game developers to incentivize participation in both their premium and free games. The motto of the ION cryptocurrency platform economy is “The Business of Fun”, and it mainly tries to add a social component to digital currency, making it fun and bringing in the possibility for networking.\r\n\r\nION is a digital currency which is primarily given as rewards and incentives to gamers playing on its platform, Economy. It aims to make cryptocurrency fun and social, while simultaneously rewarding gamers for participation. The ION cryptocurrency works on the “static proof-of-stake” consensus system, which ensures that inactive investors cannot take advantage of it. The “Connectivity” system it works on makes the rewards proportional to the number of active users, promoting the community and keeping things fair while encouraging more people to participate. ION has also implemented a master node network, which can be used to perform advanced functions and ensure smoother and much faster transactions for larger holders.\r\n\r\nThe best part of ION, perhaps, is that ION tokens are given as a reward to gamers playing on the economy platform, and they are free to trade the coins for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, too. Rather than other popular cryptocurrencies that focus on buying and selling of goods and are investment-centric (like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e), ION is focused on the gaming sector. It aims to give active gamers an incentive for participation and game developers a chance to add monetary incentives to their freedom as well as premium games. It’s focused on “everything that’s fun”, according to the ionomy website, whose very motto is “The Business of Fun”.\r\n\r\nFor a cryptocurrency launched before the crypto boom in 2017, ION has its advantages, the main one being that it boasts of being “fun”, unlike any other currency. The reward of winning is adequate for a true gamer, but an incentive involving money doesn’t hurt. Games on the ION platform like “To The Moon (Beta)” and “Crypto Gravity” (available for both Android and iOS) are gaining ground among gamers, and ION can only go up from where it is currently. Another perk of the ION cryptocurrency is that if you invest in it, in-app purchases on the games in the ION platform come much cheaper. ION developers offer up to 50% off on the purchases, if ION tokens are used. The cryptocurrency has just about started gaining ground within the gaming community, and its motto of “fun” and accessible nature are its selling points, making it likely to give returns in the long term.","web":"https://ionomy.com/","twt":"ionomics","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ion","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/ionomy/ion"}},{"currencyName":"IOP","info":{"desc":"","web":"http://iop.global/","twt":"IoP_community","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IoP_Community/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Internet-of-People/mercury-rust"}},{"currencyName":"IOU","info":{"desc":"iou1 (Symbol: IOU) is a digital currency that provides assurance and trust in the negotiation and agreement process.

The team behind 0x strongly believes that in the future, you will find thousands of tokens from Ethereum and that 0x can provide an efficient and trustworthy way to exchange them.\r\n\r\n0x have several benefits such as it can be any asset. The 0x protocol facilitates the exchange of a growing number of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id\u003d279\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eEthereum-based tokens\u003c/a\u003e including currencies, game items, and many more digital assets.

Thus, the 0x protocol uses off-chain order books, which is maintained by a relayer for settlement of trade between two parties. Relayers, being behind the maintenance and creation of these channels are incentivised by charging and collecting fees.\r\n\r\n0x (ZRX) Token:\r\n\r\nZRX token is the unique aspect of 0x project which will be used to pay ‘relayers the trading fees by the users of the protocol.

Online gambling is a $52 billion a year industry.\r\n\r\nAt its founding the project included Intrade founder Ron Bernstein, Robin Hanson, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin among its advisers. In April 2015, Augur\u0027s first contract was uploaded to the Ethereum network.The first beta version was released in March 2016.

It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id\u003d29\"\u003esmart contract platform\u003c/a\u003e which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTechnological Innovation\u003c/b\u003e\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm\u003dProof+of+Stake\u0026view\u003dmarket\"\u003eproof of stake algorithm\u003c/a\u003e. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eConceptual Innovation\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum\u0027s case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\"\u003eDaedalus\u003c/a\u003e\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by \u003ca href\u003d\"https://iohk.io/\"\u003eIOHK\u003c/a\u003e specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\"\u003eEthereum Classic\u003c/a\u003e and many more.\r\n\r\nThe \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\"\u003eCardano Foundation\u003c/a\u003e\r\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\r\n\r\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\r\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano’s wide-ranging potential\r\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Focus:\r\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\r\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\r\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem.

Decentralized applications built on Cardano technology, funded and supported by Emurgo, will have the potential to build groundbreaking applications.\r\n\r\nProject Road Map\r\nIOHK has now released the settlement layer. This means you can transact, trade, and purchase Ada tokens fully independently of the computation layer. The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, users will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.\r\nIn 2019, IOHK intends to work on Cardano’s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that is capable of funding and supporting itself.","web":"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/","twt":"CardanoStiftung","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/fm-ouroboros"}},{"currencyName":"REQ","info":{"desc":"A decentralized network built on top of Ethereum, which allows anyone, anywhere to request a payment.

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there’s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let’s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that’s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He’s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.","web":"https://singularitynet.io/","twt":"singularity_net","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetsub/","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/singnet/singnet"}},{"currencyName":"ZYD","info":{"desc":"ZayedCoin (Symbol: ZYD) is a proof of work digital currency which employs the Bitcoin hashing algorithm with the block time of 90 seconds.

Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\r\n\r\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale\u003den\"\u003eMyCrypto\u003c/a\u003e, or Coinfy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space.

RLC is short for “Run on Lots of Computers.”\r\n\r\niExec is headquartered at Lyon, France. It was founded by Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, both are serving as Chief Executive Officer and Head of Asian-Pacific Region of iExec, respectively. Oleg Lodygensky is the Chief Technical Officer. Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain’s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec’s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP “implements all the needed features” to make this possible on a global scale, including “fault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.” Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project’s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec. They’re quick to note that decentralized cloud storage providers like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/filecoin\"\u003eFilecoin\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storj\"\u003eStorj\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\"\u003eSiacoin\u003c/a\u003e are not direct competitors, and it’s easy to see why.  While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it’s not a storage platform; it’s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\"\u003eGolem\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\"\u003eSONM\u003c/a\u003e.

We have multiple development projects already running, such as Cocobay Danang and Marine City in Vietnam, and we are offering the world\u0027s first real estate pre-IPO blockchain offering before the fund lists on the New York Stock Exchange. For transparency, all of our contracts are posted on our website. \r\n\r\nRelex is a blockchain based funding vehicle creation of the parent company Squawk Advisors Inc. Squawk Advisors has an FDI development portfolio across multiple countries in the world. The Squawk group of companies has been contracting with FDI projects since 2014, and this Fall 2017, we are bringing our offerings onto the blockchain, such as Cocobay Danang, with its iconic tower seen here.\r\n\r\nRelex is the world\u0027s first cryptocurrency based real estate developer opportunity. RLX holders have the opportunity to invest in projects during the development phase, which results in exciting opportunities such as proxy ownership of resorts, shopping malls, offices, and more. And gain more rights as a proxy developer, having your voice heard regarding design and implementation of the final master plan.\r\n\r\nThere is now a better way to access yield, while retaining your standards for high transparency and high accountability for your investable capital. Introducing Relex, the world\u0027s first real estate development focused cryptocurrency, designed to provide better and simplified access for investors to high-yield projects around the world, while qualifying real estate projects to a higher level of transparency in order to be eligible for institutional capital consideration. We support projects in both developed and developing markets that strive to set the bar higher in the interest of project integrity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jones Lang Lasalle\u0027s Global Real Estate Transparency Index 2016, almost 75% of global capital invested in commercial real estate is in the Top 10 most transparent countries in the world. That means that projects in countries with low transparency scores are considered ineligible projects for investment. What if transparency scores in projects located in developing countries were improved, upgrading these projects and making them eligible for a wider stream of capital consideration? Relex is solving this problem by increasing transparency and accountability standards for real estate development projects in developing nations with low transparency scores, and aligns itself with projects that are committed to transparency, integrity, and accountability in their real estate projects. With Relex, the projects that we partner with agree to fund their development projects on the Relex blockchain, and agree to a more strict line of transparency and accountability standards.\r\n\r\nIn turn, projects on the Relex blockchain get an increased transparency and accountability score, and become eligible for a wider stream of investable capital into their projects. This is a win-win situation for both the investor and the project owners, in which there is better capital access, and better access to real estate development projects with a high degree of yield.","web":"https://relex.io/","twt":"RelexTalk","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RelexRLX/","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"BRIT","info":{"desc":"","web":"https://britcoin.com/","twt":"britcoin3uk","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/britcoin3","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/Brit-Coin/britcoin"}},{"currencyName":"RMC","info":{"desc":"RMC token is a digital asset that certifies the right of an individual or legal entity to join Joint Mining Club, as well as confirms the owner\u0027s right to receive a miner Multiсlet according to terms and conditions in the agreement","web":"https://rmc.one/","twt":"russianminerco","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"DGMS","info":{"desc":"Live Digigems prices from all markets and DGMS coin market Capitalization.

Safecoin will serve as the currency for the SAFE network, a network made up of the extra hard disk space, processing power, and data connectivity of its users. Think of it as the sharing economy but for your digital resources. MaidSafe is the company developing the SAFE network to save the world from the perils of centralized data storage. In the current paradigm, the best case is corporations use your data to better target you to their advertisers. The worst case is they leak your private data to the public, as Yahoo, Equifax, Target, and many other companies have already done.\r\n\r\nThe SAFE network ultimately wants to “create a secure, autonomous, data-centric, peer-to-peer network as an alternative to the current server-centric model.” There will be two main users of the network: clients and farmers. The client accesses the various features of the network, such as browsing, storing data, or transferring money. The farmers store and look after your data until it’s needed, at which point they might receive a reward for their efforts. The SAFE network is an “encrypted layer that sits on top of the current internet, allowing for autonomous data storage and networking by replacing three” of the OSI networking layers.\r\n\r\nMaidSafe, a Scotland based company, started developing the SAFE network in 2006. The presale on April 22nd, 2014 sold 10% of all MaidSafeCoins. You could buy 17,000 MaidSafeCoins for 1 BTC at that time. The company allowed 30 days to try and reach their 8 million dollar fundraising goal, but they reached the target in just 5 hours.\r\n\r\nThe team is currently in stage Alpha 2 on their roadmap. the future of this crypto, quite like other presently available cryptos such as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitshares\"\u003eBitShares\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano\"\u003eCardano\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dent\"\u003eDent\u003c/a\u003e, looks bright because the concept of having a decentralized internet is a fresh one.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the ‘official’ cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson. It was originally based on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\"\u003eLitecoin\u003c/a\u003e, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\"\u003eDigiByte\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network’s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Grøstl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBTC\u003c/a\u003e blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.","web":"https://www.aurorachain.io/","twt":"AuroraOffic_en","reddit":"","forum":""}},{"currencyName":"DGPT","info":{"desc":"Our goal is to ensure that people pass their digital assets on to the rightful inheritors, in case of the owner’s death and to tackle the issue of escheatment in the digital era.","web":"https://www.digipulse.io/","twt":"DigiPulseIO","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Digipulse","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/digipulseio/dgpt-node"}},{"currencyName":"ACOIN","info":{"desc":"Acoin was designed from the ground up and is designed to be a rare currency.

Unlike other legacy systems, Arbitrage’s aBot doesn\u0027t sell but actually short sells designated cryptocurrencies on the short exchange, this feature offers two important advantages.\r\n\r\nFirst, the strategy is always market-neutral, meaning as the cryptocurrency market\u0027s moves (up or down) it doesn\u0027t impact the strategy of returns. In simple terms, this removes a huge amount of risk from the platform’s overall return strategy as the market could suddenly lose half its value and this won\u0027t make any difference in the strategy returns. \r\n\r\nSecond, the aBOT\u0027s strategy doesn\u0027t need to transfer cryptofunds (e.g. BTC, LTC or Fiat) between cryptocurrency exchanges. \r\nThe buy/sell and sell/buy opposing trade activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges, independently.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Decentralised Platform\r\nArbitraging ecosystem is collection of unique products and capabilities that is structured to realise the decentralised nature of the exchange and access to the Arbitrage BoT financial trading technology. The platform architecture either leverages the full scope of the Arbitrage Trading BoT (as detailed earlier) or provides unique storage and management functionality for the investor. \r\n\r\nThe proprietary decentralized blockchain provides a seamless approach to arbitrage fintech services by combining a number of noteworthy innovations from token storage and management, and a number of integrated functional services. Whatever the investor experience level, the interface has been designed to be accessible (i.e. mobile and desktop environments) with simplicity and functionality in mind. It focuses on features that will enable easy transactions and subsequent tracking, and the ability to use ARB Tokens to access internal products and future projects. \r\n\r\nARB asset management and storage options can be simply divided into two levels: external wallets for long-term storage and dedicated digital wallet apps. The decentralised nature of the exchange enables ARB stored on any external ERC20 compatible wallets (e.g. MyEtherWallet or MetaMask). This ensures that tokens are always held separate and furthermore when the Arbitrage trading BoT is active, those tokens are sent to an external cold storage wallet and the daily profits are sent back to the designated external wallet. Alternatively, the dedicated ARB-wallet application (currently under development) will be able to exchange directly with the ARB Trading platform thereby significantly reducing funds transfer and transaction latency. This integrated concept will also eventually feature for the ardent crypto investor, compatibility with hard-storage devices such as the Trezor and Nano-Ledger. \r\n\r\nIn summary the Arbitraging ecosystem presents an innovative approach to a complex crypto-trading strategy that is characterised by a proprietary ERC20 based decentralized blockchain, token management system and fully integrated external wallet and hard storage technologies.

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials.

In this virtual world, you purchase plots of land that you can later traverse, build upon, and monetize. There’s no limit to what you can do. It’s the first digital platform that’s completely owned by its users. Similar to games like Skyrim and Fallout, Decentraland is an all-immersive virtual universe. However, instead of playing on a 2-dimensional screen, you participate in a 3-dimensional world. It seems to be the logical next step before creating full-blown AI-based games in the physical space à la Westworld. Similar groupings on LAND comprise Districts. Districts are basically communities that revolve around a shared theme. For example, there may be a District just for crypto enthusiasts with cryptocurrency apps and services.\r\n\r\nThe Decentraland team is led by Ari Meilich (Project Lead) and Esteban Ordano (Tech Lead). Ordano previously worked at \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bitpay.com/\"\u003eBitpay\u003c/a\u003e as a software engineer and founded Smart Contract Solutions, Inc. Both founders have also worked together in creating Stremium and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcore\"\u003eBitcore\u003c/a\u003e. Decentraland has been around for longer than you may think. The team hit their first development milestone, Stone Age, in June 2015. This was a simple, pixelated grid that allocated pixels to users through a proof-of-work algorithm. Most recently, they held a Terraform Event in which they sold LAND in the new, 3D world. The team has also partnered with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x\"\u003edistrict0x\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon\"\u003eAragon\u003c/a\u003e, and imToken to provide some of their services. \r\n\r\nMANA is the token used to buy lands in Decentraland. The Blockchain platform can be incorporated in order to buy or sell the various digital assets available in the virtual world. An unclaimed land would have the same market pricing on every exchange possible and precisely the developers are on a hunt for such since as they can build on top of it, and attract lot of popularity. However, one must keep in mind that the land parcels are different from them and each one of them varies according to the various market conditions of that time. Mana can be a great investment and can be bought by trading and with other \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e, or any other prominent cryptocurrency and on some of the most notable cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\"\u003eBinance\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/huobi\"\u003eHuobi\u003c/a\u003e are two of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that one can suggest for trading Mana tokens.\r\n\r\nThe Decentraland coin isn’t a minable cryptocurrency as it is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, unlike Bitcoin and other similar currencies.

This fundamental feature is difficult to overestimate, as it increases the efficiency of bandwidth blockchain.\r\nAnother available advanced feature is ATB-Code, which is the ability to cold store and transfer coins via code.

And the lack of specialization leads to problems that are specific to transferring assets. Ravencoin enables you to create and trade any real-world (e.g., gold bars, land deeds) or digital (e.g., gaming items, software licenses) assets on a network with only that in mind.\r\n\r\nRavencoin doesn’t have an established team. It’s an open-source project led by the core developers: RavoncoinDev, Tron, and Chatturga (discord usernames). Bruce Fenton, Board Member of The Bitcoin Foundation, advises the team. The core developers launched Ravencoin on January 3rd, 2018 and Fenton kicked off the launch with a Tweet announcing the start of mining. The project gained some notoriety when Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company had made a multi-million dollar investment into the team. Since then, the team has been building out the core functionality of asset support and rewards capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe release of the Ravencoin mainnet and increase in activity on the platform should help the price. Any news of notable companies or financial institutions utilizing the platform should also have a positive effect. Ravencoin offers just one thing: tokenized asset transfer. And that singular focus isn’t a bad thing. When projects attempt to solve a bunch of problems at once, they often create a bunch of half-baked solutions. Ravencoin is avoiding that. As a young project with seemingly endless competition, it’s difficult to predict how successful Ravencoin will be. An active community and backing from one of the most respected names in online retail are positive indicators, though. There’s a clear trend toward the tokenization of all types of assets. However, we have yet to see whether or not Ravencoin will be leading that change.","web":"https://ravencoin.org/","twt":"ravencoin","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ravencoin","forum":"","github":"https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin"}},{"currencyName":"AUA","info":{"desc":"Live ArubaCoin prices from all markets and AUA coin market Capitalization.

You can connect directly with peers and transact without the need for a middleman like Amazon, eBay, or Craigslist. Transactions are secure and anonymous. They’re also guaranteed by escrow. The project aims to be the new standard for eCommerce, allowing individuals to trade one-to-one at scale. As a result, BitBay claims it will revolutionize global trade. It’s seemingly a great solution for other niche applications as well, where groups of people aren’t served by existing marketplaces. In the beginning, BitBay got off to a rocky start. In 2014, the original founders raised capital in bad faith and quickly abandoned the project after fundraising, leaving the lead developer holding the bag. It seemed like BitBay was finished, but the developer continued working on the project out of a sense of duty to the original investors, without access to the capital raised in the fundraising round.\r\n\r\nThe BAY token is the transactional token in the marketplace. You use it to buy and sell, and it can also participate in freezes, escrow, bets, swaps, etc. The token itself operates like Bitcoin and is secured by the network. Although you can use BAY for transactions, you don’t have to. You do, however, have to use BAY if you’d like to take part in token staking. BAY’s price cratered after the original founders left and stayed low until March 2017 when it took off. It has been through several cycles of bull and bear runs, with a max price over 30 cents in January 2018 before retreating to its current value.\r\n\r\nBitBay supports all kinds of privacy and security measures. It’s easy to create a multisignature wallet for added security. There are integrations for Tor and other proxies that help anonymize your connection to the marketplace. An on-screen keyboard allows for password or key entry without using your keyboard and being susceptible to keylogging. Additionally, you can create images with your private key embedded, so that finding a stored key is more difficult for a hacker. The marketplace also has functionality for time locking contracts and swapping currencies. This enables all kinds of cross-chain transactions and financial implements. The time lock and other smart contract elements make it possible to create bets, escrow, futures and options trades, or any number of other financial transactions.\r\n\r\nThe idea and implementation by BitBay, of a decentralized marketplace and trading platform is brilliant and shows further promise of expansion.The rocky beginning of the cryptocurrency and its subsequent comeback as a promising platform indicate that the developers are in it for the long haul and don’t plan on abandoning the platform after all these years.
